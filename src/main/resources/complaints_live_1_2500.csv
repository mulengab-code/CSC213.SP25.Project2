Why is it that anyone can walk into this branch with the death certificate and a copy of the funeral expenses and receive the money from a deceased account?

XXXX. An executor does not need to use any funds for the funeral. They can use it to pay off debts or handle probate proceedings. Why am I not able to access these funds without the very specific funeral expense receipt? 
XXXX. When I called customer service they clearly stated that I would need a court document stating I am the executor to be able to access the account but when I walked into the branch they didn't even care to see it. Who is PNC hiring to work at their branches? 
XXXX. The only way they said I could access the funds was to open an estate account with them. There is no law stating that I am required to do my estate handling with the same bank as the deceased.

On Monday, XX/XX/XXXX, I received notice from my insurance company that my home owners insurance had NOT been paid. I called my insurance company to verify and to ensure that the correspondence/payments had not crossed communications paths. They in fact had NOT received payment for my homeowners insurance. I agreed to call back after the new year 's holiday to verify payment. I called back on XX/XX/XXXX, and payment had not been received. I called New Rez, and discovered that they did not send payment to the correct insurance company. ( Note : this is the ONLY Insurance company I've had homeowners with since purchasing this house. It has NEVER changed names or locations. ) In a XXXX way call with myself, New Rez argued that they would post date a check and put in in the mail today ; however, insurance company, the insurance company stated that there is NO grace period, and that payment MUST be received by XXXXXXXX XXXX. on XX/XX/XXXX or I would not have insurance, and that I would not be eligible for reinstatement. After some discussion and arguments quite frankly between the insurance provided and New Rez, New Rez agree to stop payment on check and that they would pay via phone electronically to my insurance XXXX before close of business. 
After hours on the phone and multiple call backs ( on recorded lines ) New Rez had not made payment by close of business on Friday, and I was promised that they would do so on Monday, XX/XX/XXXX. They did not, and as of XXXX XXXX XXXX, New Rez has still NOT paid my insurance premiums. I was forced to do so with money I do not have to ensure no gap in coverage. In a phone conversation on XX/XX/XXXX, I was informed by New Rez that they still hadn't paid my homeowners insurance!!

2024-11-21,Credit reporting or other personal consumer reports,Credit reporting,Incorrect information on your report,Information is missing that should be on the report,""" The Fair Credit Reporting Act ( 15 U.S. Code 1681 ) says ( 1 ) The banking system is dependent upon fair and accurate credit reporting. Inaccurate credit reports directly impair the efficiency of the banking system, and unfair credit reporting methods undermine the public confidence, which is essential to the continued functioning of the banking system.

So whenever there is a violation under the FCRA, it impairs the efficiency of the banking system. This is a violation of my privacy with my consumer report, since I control what is listed and what is not. In the event that any accounts are reported without my written consent, that is considered identity theft.

This is a violation of both 15 U.S. Code 1681b ( 2 ) and 15 U.S. Code 1681c-2. This leads way to civil liability against the credit reporting agency for negligent and willful noncompliance under 15 U.S. Code 1681n, which allows for {$1000.00} per violation, for each account listed without my expressed written consent.

I looked at my consumer reports and noticed accounts I never gave anyone permission to report. Consumer reporting agencies have assumed a vital role and have a responsibility to report consumer information to the best of their ability with maximum possible accuracy like the Fair Credit Reporting Act clearly states. I did not provide written consent to report them.

During the time my cell phone was changed to new carrier someone was able to move money around in my different accounts with Wells Fargo. I have their mobile app and online banking. They took money out of all the savings accounts and moved it to the checking account that is tied to the debit card with the fraudulent charges. I immediately called Wells Fargo fraud department and reported everything. They opened a claim. I visited my Wells Fargo branch as soon as possible and sat down with a representative who assured me that I did not need to change my account and I just needed a new debit card. After XXXX  days Wells Fargo refunded the stolen money back into my checking account. I visited my Wells Fargo branch again and sat with the same representative. She now said that I need to change my accounts before they could let me back onto online banking. I did as they asked. On XX/XX/XXXX Wells Fargo took back the money they had provisionally given me and said that they could not prove fraud. No one had ever called to talk to me about it or get any more information from me. I have called XXXX XXXX and found that the address for the orders was in Florida. I have documentation from XXXX XXXX XXXX showing that my phone was hacked. I thought your bank was supposed to help you in these situations. {$XXXX} dollars is not a lot to most people but it is a lot to my family.

This is the second dispute regarding this matter, following my previous complaint on XX/XX/XXXX, which has yet to be adequately resolved. 
Pursuant to the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) under 15 USC 1681i ( a ) ( 7 ), I request a detailed description of the investigation process your agency followed concerning this account. This information must be provided within 15 days, as stipulated by the FCRA. 
Details of the Dispute : The account in question has been incorrectly reported with late payments as follows : Equifax : XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX XXXX : XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX XXXX : XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX These late payments are erroneous, as I consistently made all payments on time according to the agreed-upon terms. 
Account Information : Account Number : XXXX High Balance : {$31000.00} Date Opened : XX/XX/XXXX Date Closed : XX/XX/XXXX Current Status : Closed Account Type : Automotive Loan Payment Status : Paid or Paying as Agreed ( per XXXX and Equifax XXXX ; Incorrectly reported as "" Paid, was past due 30 days XXXX or XXXX times '' ( XXXX ). 
Monthly Payment : {$0.00} ( account closed ). 
Violation of Federal Laws : Under 15 USC 1681c, credit reporting agencies are required to ensure the accuracy of the information they report. Late payments negatively impact my credit history and do not align with my actual payment history. Further, per 15 USC 1681s-2 ( b ), furnishers of information are obligated to correct inaccuracies upon dispute. 
Additionally, under 15 USC 1666 ( b ), creditors are required to adopt reasonable procedures to ensure statements and due dates are communicated appropriately to consumers.

Reference to PAANL ( Paid As Agreed Never Late ) : The terms of my agreement with XXXX XXXX XXXX have always been adhered to. This account should reflect a status of "" Paid As Agreed, Never Late '' because all payments were made in a timely manner. 
The inaccurate reporting of late payments undermines my financial responsibility and adversely affects my creditworthiness. As the FCRA mandates, consumer reports must be accurate and complete. Failure to correct this error will constitute a breach of this obligation. 
To clarify, under 15 USC 1681a ( c ) and 1681b ( a ) ( 2 ) ( A ) ( i ), information reflecting transactions and experiences solely between me ( the consumer ) and the creditor must be reported accurately. Reporting incorrect late payments violates this requirement. 
Requested Action : Immediate Correction : Update the payment history on this account to reflect "" Paid As Agreed, Never Late '' across all three credit bureaus. 
Investigation Documentation : Provide a description of the procedures used to investigate this dispute, including the steps taken to verify the accuracy of the reported late payments. 
Proof of Late Payments : If the late payments can not be corrected, provide documented proof, including dates, amounts, and supporting communication validating these claims. 
Supporting Documentation : Enclosed, you will find : My previous dispute letter dated XX/XX/XXXX. 
Copies of my credit reports from XXXX, XXXX, and Equifax showing the incorrect late payment entries. 
Expectations and Compliance : Per the FCRA, I request a written response within 30 days of receipt of this letter. Failure to correct these inaccuracies or provide the required documentation will be considered a violation of the FCRA and may lead to further action. 
I trust your agency will take immediate action to ensure my credit report reflects accurate and fair information. I expect a resolution that aligns with the legal obligations outlined by the FCRA, the Consumer Protection Act, and the Truth in Lending Act.

XXXX ) Credit Repair Organizations Act ( CROA ) This law prohibits the use of false or misleading representations regarding credit repair services.

( XXXX XXXX. XXXX ) Truth in Lending Act ( TILA ) This act ensures transparency in lending practices. If XXXX  XXXX is reporting inaccurate credit information that is potentially fraudulent, they are violating TILA by failing to provide consumers with accurate and clear information regarding their credit accounts. ( XXXX XXXX. XXXX ) State Consumer Protection Laws Depending on your state of residence, various state laws may provide additional consumer protections against unfair credit reporting and lending practices.

This law requires credit reporting agencies to conduct a reasonable reinvestigation of disputed items. Recent findings by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ) have raised serious concerns about Experians failure to properly investigate consumer disputes.

In a lawsuit filed against Experian, the CFPB alleges that the company engaged in inadequate investigations, violating consumer protection laws and failing to meet its obligations under the FCRA. Under 15 U.S.C. 1681i ( a ) ( 1 ) ( A ), Experian is legally required to conduct a thorough and reasonable reinvestigation of disputed items within 30 days. Additionally, per 15 U.S.C. 1681i ( a ) ( 5 ), any information found to be inaccurate, incomplete, or unverifiable must be promptly deleted or corrected. Failure to comply with these provisions constitutes a violation of federal law.

I formally request that Experian : 1. Conduct a thorough reinvestigation of the following disputed accounts or items : Such as XXXX, any other bill on my account 2. Provide all documentation used to verify the accuracy of the disputed information.

3. Correct or delete any information that can not be verified or is inaccurate, as required by law.

Given the CFPBs recent findings, I expect Experian to address this dispute with the highest level of diligence and in full compliance with legal requirements.

After my credit was pulled, I waited to meet with the finance team. At about XXXX, I finally sat down with the finance manager ( XXXX XXXX XXXX  ) to sign the documents. However, he informed me that we couldn't complete the transaction that night due to the fraud alert on my credit report. He assured me that Mercedes Financial would contact me the next business day, to lift the fraud restriction. Given that my home is XXXX minutes away and I had to get up for work the next morning, I was understandably exhausted. 

On Tuesday, XX/XX/XXXX, I received no call from Mercedes Financial, so I decided to reach out to the dealership around XXXX. I spoke with the General Manager XXXX, who was kind enough to call Mercedes on my behalf. He was informed that my financing was blocked because multiple applications with varying information had been submitted under my name in XXXX. This was a result of Identity theft, which clarified the issue. I would appreciate your assistance, and clear me for leasing again, with Mercedes Financial. I am a loyal customer who previously purchased in XXXX and leased a vehicle in XXXX. Currently, I am without a vehicle, having sent my car to my niece last Tuesday, who is attending college.

After a careful examination of my credit report, I have identified a significant error that is adversely affecting my creditworthiness. The issue at hand involves the inaccurate reporting of late payments, specifically 30-day, 60-day, and 90-day late payments, multiple times in connection with the repossession of the mentioned vehicle. They also never sent me a notice of sale or cancellation of contract since they sold my vehicle. they sent this to an old address. when i attempted to get the car back it was already sold. i was never told where the vehicle was etc.

The inaccurate listing of late payments is causing considerable harm to my credit score and is misleading as it suggests that I was delinquent on payments after the repossession had taken place. It is illogical and impossible for a repossessed vehicle to have accrued 90-day late payments multiple times when I no longer had possession of the vehicle.

This inaccurate reporting is damaging my creditworthiness and creating an unjust representation of my financial history. I request that you thoroughly investigate this matter and correct the entry accordingly.

The misreporting of this account has persisted for an extended period, and I have made previous attempts to rectify this issue without success.

I have repeatedly contacted Capital One to request the issuance of a Form 1099-C, as required under the Internal Revenue Code, but have not received any resolution despite multiple attempts over an extended period. 

Pursuant to 15 U.S.C. 1681 ( Fair Credit Reporting Act ), consumers are entitled to accurate and fair reporting of credit information. Furthermore, under IRS guidelines, when a debt is charged off, the creditor is typically required to issue a Form 1099-C if the debt meets specific thresholds for cancellation. This failure to provide a Form 1099-C has caused considerable personal and financial stress, as I need this documentation for my tax filings. 

Additionally, I have observed that Capital One continues to report late payments on this charged-off account each month. Once an account is charged off, the addition of late payments contradicts accurate reporting practices and unfairly penalizes my credit standing, further exacerbating my difficulties. 

This unresolved issue has had a profound and stressful impact on my life, preventing me from moving forward with purchasing my first home for my family. I request the CFPBs assistance in ensuring Capital One complies with its legal obligations by : 1. Issuing the Form 1099-C for the charged-off debt.

2. Ensuring the account is accurately reported on my credit file without further monthly late payment notations. 



I respectfully request a resolution to this matter within 15 days from the date of this letter. Please let me know if further information is required to expedite this process.

This failure violates the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) and the Truth in Lending Act ( TILA ). 
FCRA Violations Under 15 U.S. Code 1681i, credit reporting agencies are required to ensure the accuracy of the information in consumer files. The presence of late payment notations that are demonstrably inaccurate violates this mandate. Additionally, creditors are obligated to send accurate information to the credit bureaus as outlined in 15 U.S. Code 1681s-2.

TILA Violations As per 15 U.S. Code 1666b, periodic statements must be provided at least 21 days before the payment due date. The inaccurate late payment reporting suggests that the creditor may have failed to comply with this requirement.

Protection Against Non-Payment of Obligations Act ( PAANL ) This act reinforces the need for creditors to send timely and accurate statements to prevent unfair penalties to consumers, which has not been adhered to in this case.

The continuous failure to address these inaccuracies has caused significant harm to my creditworthiness, affecting my ability to secure credit and financial opportunities.

Desired Resolution : Immediate removal of the inaccurate late payment notations from my credit report.

Written confirmation of the correction within 15 business days.

If this issue is not resolved promptly, I will escalate my complaint to include legal action and additional complaints with other relevant regulatory agencies.

This account is reporting conflicting information across credit bureaus, including discrepancies in the open dateone bureau reports XX/XX/XXXX, while another shows XX/XX/XXXX. Additionally, there are inconsistencies in the high credit balance and the date last active ( DLA ), which is critical in determining how long an account remains on a credit report. The DLA is listed as both XXXX and XXXX, raising concerns about potential re-aging of the account. 

The DLA plays a key role in determining the statute of limitations for debt collection and legal action. It appears that your company may have manipulated this date to make an old debt appear new, effectively restarting the reporting timeline and making it more difficult to remove outdated negative information. Credit reporting must be accurate and consistent across all bureaus, and the discrepancies in this account indicate misleading and inaccurate reporting, which is grounds for dispute.

As a result, my private financial details may have been improperly accessed or disclosed, which violates my fundamental right to privacy.

If an account or collection item is the result of a data breach or improper access to your personal information, it is considered inaccurate and unauthorized reporting, which can lead to harm in terms of credit scoring and personal privacy. 

3. **Violation of Privacy** : The exposure of my private information through this data breach is a clear violation of my privacy rights under both state and federal laws. When a consumer 's data is compromised, the consumer may have grounds to dispute the legitimacy of any resulting debts or collections that are reported based on this breach.

4. **Right to Dispute and Remove Inaccurate Information** : In light of these facts, I am exercising my right under the Fair Credit Reporting Act to dispute the accuracy of this account.

The account details are as follows : Creditor : XXXX XXXX XXXX Account Number : XXXX Date Opened : XX/XX/XXXX Background : In XX/XX/XXXX, I was notified of a data breach that compromised my personal information. Subsequently, I discovered that a XXXX XXXX XXXX account had been fraudulently opened in my name without my authorization. 
Upon identifying this unauthorized account, I promptly disputed its validity with XXXX, XXXX, and XXXX. Despite providing evidence of its fraudulent nature, all three credit bureaus have verified its legitimacy and continue to report it on my credit files. 
Alleged Violations : I believe the actions of the aforementioned credit bureaus constitute violations of federal law, specifically : 1. 15 U.S.C. 1692gValidation of Debts : This statute mandates that debt collectors provide proper debt validation upon request. The continued reporting of this unauthorized account suggests that the credit bureaus have not ensured that the debt was properly validated, especially considering the circumstances of identity theft.

2. 15 U.S.C. 1635 Right of Rescission : While this section primarily pertains to the right to rescind certain credit transactions, it underscores the necessity of clear and accurate credit agreements. The existence of a fraudulent account indicates a failure to uphold these standards. 
Request for CFPB Intervention : In light of the above, I respectfully request the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to : Investigate the verification processes employed by XXXX, XXXX, and XXXX concerning this disputed account. 
Ensure that the unauthorized XXXX XXXX XXXX account is immediately deleted from my credit reports. 
Review and address any systemic issues within these credit bureaus that may allow for inadequate verification of disputed accounts, especially in identity theft resulting from data breaches. 
I trust that the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau will take this matter seriously and take appropriate action to rectify the situation. 
Thank you for your attention to this urgent issue.

It is evident that the inclusion of these fraudulent items violates 15 USC 1681b regarding permissible purposes, as the credit bureaus have no legitimate reason to report them without my explicit consent. Please refer to the attached file detailing these items I am disputing.

The Fair Credit Reporting Act ( 15 U.S. Code 1681 ) says ( XXXX ) The banking system is dependent upon fair and accurate credit reporting. Inaccurate credit reports directly impair the efficiency of the banking system, and unfair credit reporting methods undermine the public confidence, which is essential to the continued functioning of the banking system. So whenever there is a violation under the FCRA, it impairs the efficiency of the banking system. This is a violation of my privacy with my consumer report, since I control what is listed and what is not.

Initially, XXXX XXXX, Vice President and Branch and Business Center Manager ( NMLS XXXX ), assured me that the account was successfully opened and in good standing. However, shortly after, XXXX XXXX contacted me again, stating that the account could not be opened. This abrupt reversal was perplexing and lacked a clear explanation. Despite my requests for a detailed reason, XXXX XXXX was unable to provide a satisfactory answer. 

I provided PNC with all the relevant campaign information they requested. Moreover, I was not aware that my personal credit would be checked, as this was not a personal account. I had previously held a campaign account with PNC in XXXX without such issues. XXXX XXXX later informed me that the decision came from "" higher up '' in the bank, which was contradictory in nature and caused my campaign to get off to a rocky and slow start. 

I possess email correspondence that supports this sequence of events. To my further confusion, on XX/XX/XXXX, I received letters from PNC Bank containing a PIN number for online banking access, implying that the account was active. Subsequently, I received another letter from PNC XXXX XXXX, indicating that information from credit bureaus had influenced their decision regarding my account. 

Contrary to XXXX XXXX 's earlier assertion that the account could not be opened, it became evident that the account was indeed active until XX/XX/XXXX. On XX/XX/XXXX, I received a letter stating that my account had a negative balance of {$24.00}. This series of contradictory communications raises serious concerns about the transparency and integrity of PNC Bank 's practices. 

The initial change of position by XXXX XXXX, followed by the subsequent confusing correspondence, leads me to believe that there may have been discriminatory motives behind the handling of my account. As a returning citizen and a public political figure, I suspect that my background and political career influenced PNC Bank 's decision-making process. This perceived discrimination warrants a thorough investigation into PNC Bank 's practices to ensure that no individual is unjustly treated based on their background or public standing. 

I am prepared to provide all relevant documentation, including email correspondence and letters from PNC Bank, to support my claim and seek a fair resolution.

Summary of the Issue : 1. Unauthorized Transactions : My Chime account was hacked, and unauthorized transactions totaling {$600.00} were made. I immediately reported this to Chime and cooperated fully in their investigation.

2. Denied Disputes : Chime denied my dispute without providing clear documentation or explanation of their decision, as required under Regulation E.

3. Refusal to Reopen the Claim : Despite Regulation Es requirements, Chime refuses to reopen my claim unless I provide new or additional information. This places an undue burden on me and is not a lawful prerequisite to reexamine their decision. 

4.Inappropriate Questions : Chimes disputes team asked me to specify the additional documentation I have, which I believe is an attempt to deter me from pursuing my claim further. I have never been asked this in previous claims.

Violations of Federal Law : Chimes actions violate multiple provisions of the EFTA and Regulation E : Failure to Investigate Properly ( 1005.11 ) : Chimes denial of my dispute suggests an incomplete investigation. The burden of proof lies with Chime, not the consumer, to demonstrate that the transactions were authorized. 
Failure to Provide Documentation : Regulation E requires the financial institution to provide the consumer with evidence supporting its denial. Chime has failed to do so.

Unlawful Refusal to Reopen Claims : Chime is requiring additional information to reopen a claim, which is not a legal obligation for the consumer.

Requested Resolution : I request the CFPBs intervention to ensure that Chime : 1. Immediately reopens my dispute and conducts a proper investigation into the unauthorized transactions.

2. Reverses the unauthorized charges and restores my account balance to XXXX.

3. Provides all documentation and explanations regarding the initial denial of my dispute.

If my account is in good standing, then my payment history should align with that status. This contradiction not only defies logic but also violates my rights under federal law.

I knew the administrative forbearance was about to end so I wanted to check on my student loan status.

On XX/XX/year> I was able to get through. I was instructed to go online to set up an Income Driven Repayment form. Anytime I spoke with someone, I'd ask about the status of my loan, I was informed that I was in good standing. I did as the agent said and my application was accepted. 
When I still hadn't heard any response back, I tried to email to follow up on my application status. The response I received was to reach out again to my student loan servicer. I would call and try to get through but on the morning of XX/XX/XXXX, I was able to get through. I was told that they needed a self certifying letter for my income. I told them I would have gladly submitted that, earlier, had they let me know that it was needed. As always, I asked about the status of my account and they said it was good, they just needed that document. I decided I would submit it as soon as I got off of the phone, but because of the trouble I had getting through and the lack of communication I was receiving from XXXX, I requested a forbearance in addition to my Income Driven Repayment Plan, so I could be covered if there were any further delays. 
They approved it immediately and I uploaded the self- certification letter as soon as we ended the call. That night I received a notification from Experian that there was a score decrease. My score went from a XXXX to a XXXX over night. I was still in the process of disputing a different creditor that dropped my score from the XXXX 's. 
I have been filed disputes with Experian, written XXXX to reach out to their corporate office and have not had results. Eventually when I spoke with customer service again, they said that my account has never been in poor standing. They transferred my loan to a sister company XXXX XXXX XXXX  without my knowledge and my issue was with them. 
By the time I found out about XXXX XXXX XXXX, I'd already started the process of trying to have my loans forgiven because they qualified for it due the age and type of loan I had. My loans have never been in default or poor standing in 17 years so I was so worried that this recent error would hinder my forgiveness. 
When I reached out to XXXX XXXX XXXX, to ask them to correct the error, they also said I didn't owe them anything and that I needed to call XXXX. Neither company has addressed the issue of the tank in my credit score, but because of my recent payment history with my other creditors, my score is approaching what it was before the error. With this error fixed, It will be where it should be which is in the late XXXX 's. 
I have the additional issue now of owing over {$1000.00} more on my loan than I did before I consolidated. I'm going to begin paying it back again soon.

2024-12-20,Debt collection,Credit card debt,Attempts to collect debt not owed,Debt was result of identity theft,"Dear CFPB, I am writing to formally dispute the validity of a debt being reported under my name by Capital One, amounting to approximately {$2000.00}. I have reason to believe that this account has been compromised due to identity theft and fraudulent activity, which I reported to Capital One but have not received adequate resolution or relief. 

To the best of my knowledge, I did not authorize the transactions leading to this debt. These charges appear to have been incurred without my consent, and I have already filed an identity theft report with the appropriate authorities. Despite providing evidence of fraudulent activity, Capital One has refused to forgive the debt or adequately address the compromised nature of the account. 

This is a sticky situation because it is hard to prove my identity theft on my own behalf because I did not make a police report and I did not realize I was a victim of identity theft up until months later after it took place. The capital one account has never been my main bank account/credit/debit card used. It was always my backup, but I mainly used another bank for all of my expenses and direct deposits whenever I am employed. The only course of action I took regarding the identity theft was notifying capital one when I did realize months after the account was already in debt and closed, locking my XXXX XXXX XXXX and XXXX a new social security XXXX XXXX the old XXXX as stolen ( there is no paper proof/documentation of this in my possession ). 

As I am currently unemployed, I am unable to settle this debt and am requesting your assistance in investigating this matter further to ensure my rights as a consumer are protected. I would appreciate any steps the CFPB can take to mediate or investigate this issue, as the debt has placed a significant financial burden on me through no fault of my own. 

Thank you for your attention to this matter. Please contact me should you require further details.

I was told by an employee with TD Bank that this was possibly, only for the next billing cycle to still reflect a balance. 

I called in and was then informed that I was told incorrectly, and that they could not clear one account, even though I paid exactly as the representative instructed me. I was told that I could request my money back, and the balance would go back to the promotional plan to continue payments I have been making for 2 years. 

Instead of this occurring, they then opened a revolving credit plan on my account without my consent, and charging 29.99 % interest on the money that should have went back to the promotional rate as agreed to by the company. This has been ongoing since XXXX, and I am being charged interest each month that I do not owe as a result. I have called continuously to try to have it resolved, sent in emails, tried to escalate to a supervisor or manager or director, all for no update on the account and absolutely no satisfaction. 

In XXXX, I was then sent to collections over the interest payments that are for the credit line that was opened without my consent. My credit score also took a hit of over XXXX points, all to a customer who never missed a payment and is still making payments to date for the amount I owe- {$380.00} per month. Their collections department then began calling me 4 times a day everyday, and I voiced the issue to everyone I spoke with only to be told they would let their manager know. I told them to listen to the calls between myself and their company as all calls are recorded, and they would be able to hear everything as it was presented to me as a customer, and they should be able to correct their errors. Nearly 4 months later, still no resolution. 


I have repeatedly told everyone I spoke with that I want to pay my debts, but opening a credit line without my consent and charging me interest on said credit line is unlawful. I want to pay what I owe, not what I do not. Please inquire regarding the correction of these errors, and issue a request they redaction to correct my credit score.

I believe Experian has violated provisions of the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), specifically related to their handling of my dispute and subsequent reporting of inaccurate information.

The information in question was related to [ describe the inaccurate information, e.g., late payments, incorrect dates, or missed payments ]. 

I initiated a formal dispute with Experian on [ Insert Date of Dispute ], requesting that they investigate and correct the inaccurate information. After the dispute was processed, Experian initially updated my credit report and corrected the inaccuracies. 

However, within three to seven days of the correction, Experian reverted my credit report back to the inaccurate payment history. This reversal appears to be in direct violation of the FCRA, which mandates that credit reporting agencies must ensure the accuracy and integrity of the information they report. 

2. Violations of the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) Under the FCRA, credit reporting agencies like Experian are required to : Ensure accuracy and completeness of reported information ( Section 1681e ( b ) ) : Credit reporting agencies must follow reasonable procedures to ensure that the information reported is accurate.

Credit reports constitute private property owned solely by the individuals whose financial data they represent. The unauthorized dissemination and utilization of this information violate property rights protected by the U.S. Constitution and relevant statutory laws.

This document outlines specific legal violations, including the unauthorized dissemination of private financial data, the misuse of credit reports without consent, and violations of constitutional property rights. It provides supporting evidence and demands immediate corrective actions by the agencies addressed herein.

KEY POINTS OF CONCERN 1. Credit Reports are Private Property Legal Basis : The personal identity, financial agreements, and transaction histories contained within credit reports are private property as defined under Article IV, Section 3, Clause 2 of the U.S. Constitution.

The Supreme Courts decision in XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX ), established that private property can not be taken or used without consent or just compensation.

Statutes at Large, Vol. 48, p. 112, further reinforces protections against the unlawful use of private property.

Violation : Credit reporting agencies and financial institutions have utilized and disseminated financial data without the explicit consent of the individual. This practice effectively appropriates private property for their gain.

Examples : Incorrect information on credit reports, such as accounts that do not belong to the complainant, is reported without verification.

Unauthorized inquiries from unknown sources are recorded without consent.

Precedent Cases Supporting My Position Your failure to comply with FCRA requirements is not only a violation of my rights but also exposes your agency to liability, as demonstrated in precedent cases : XXXX XXXX TransUnion XXXX ( XXXX ) : This case emphasized that credit reporting agencies have a duty to conduct reasonable investigations beyond relying on the data provided by furnishers. 

XXXX v. TransUnion LLC ( XXXX ) : The Supreme Court upheld consumer rights in disputes related to credit reporting inaccuracies, reinforcing the accountability of credit bureaus under the FCRA. 


Requested Resolution To resolve this matter, I demand the following actions : XXXXConduct a reasonable and thorough reinvestigation of the disputed accounts and transactions associated with my identity theft. 
XXXXProvide a detailed written summary of your investigation, including the steps taken and evidence reviewed. 
XXXXImmediately block or remove all inaccurate information resulting from the identity theft. 

If this matter is not resolved promptly, I will have no choice but to escalate my complaint by filing with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ), the Federal Trade Commission ( FTC ), and potentially pursuing legal remedies.

I request that you provide verifiable proof, including my signature or electronic signature, for any reported accounts or inquiries. This letter is submitted by me personally, not through a third party, so please review it carefully. 

I did not authorize any of the actions related to these accounts or inquiries, and I believe they represent a violation of my consumer rights under the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), specifically Section 605B, which addresses the blocking of information resulting from a data breach or fraud [ 15 U.S.C. 1681c-2 ], as well as Section 604, which covers permissible purposes for consumer reports [ 15 U.S.C. 1681b ]. 

Upon contacting the companies responsible for reporting these accounts, I found that these actions were initiated without proper validation or original proof from the reporting parties. As I never authorized these accounts or inquiries, they are not factual and must be considered a result of either a data breach or illegal reporting by creditors or third-party data furnishers. 

I request that these items be promptly investigated and removed from my credit report. If you can not provide the requested proof of authorization, I expect these entries to be corrected in accordance with the law.

2025-01-15,Credit reporting or other personal consumer reports,Credit reporting,Improper use of your report,Reporting company used your report improperly,"I am submitting this formal complaint to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ) regarding ongoing violations of federal privacy laws and improper reporting practices by both XXXX and Equifax. These credit reporting agencies are unlawfully reporting charge-offs and other financial information on my credit report, which constitutes a violation of my rights under the Right to Financial Privacy Act, 12 U.S.C. 3401, as well as other federal consumer protection laws. 

It has come to my attention that XXXX and Equifax have been reporting charge-offs and related financial information that effectively disclose my personal income or financial standing without my explicit consent. Reporting such information is not only inaccurate and misleading, but it also violates my privacy rights. 

Under federal law, consumers have the right to control the dissemination of their personal financial information. The following laws are relevant to this complaint : Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), 15 U.S.C. 1681 ( b ) : The FCRA mandates that credit reporting agencies must ensure the accuracy of the information they report and limits the use of consumer reports to permissible purposes only. I have not provided explicit consent for either XXXX or Equifax to report this personal financial information. 
Fair Debt Collection Practices Act ( FDCPA ), 15 U.S.C. 1692c ( b ) : The FDCPA prohibits the unauthorized disclosure of consumer information to third parties. By reporting my financial information without my consent, both XXXX and Equifax are in violation of this provision.

Consumer Financial Protection Act ( CFPA ), 12 U.S.C. 5531 : The CFPA prohibits unfair, deceptive, or abusive acts or practices ( UDAAPs ) by financial institutions. The unauthorized reporting of my personal financial information falls under unfair and abusive practices.

Right to Financial Privacy Act, 12 U.S.C. 3401 : This law protects consumers from the unauthorized disclosure of personal financial information. The actions of XXXX and Equifax violate this statute by reporting charge-offs that effectively disclose my financial status without my consent.

Details of My Complaint Both XXXX and Equifax have reported charge-offs and other financial data on my credit reports that disclose information about my personal financial standing. These entries are harmful to my credit profile, and I have never provided consent for this information to be collected or shared with third parties. This unauthorized reporting has negatively impacted my ability to obtain credit, employment, and housing. 

I have formally disputed these inaccurate items with both XXXX and Equifax, but they have failed to properly investigate and remove the disputed information. Instead, they continue to report this data, in violation of federal law. 

My Request to the CFPB I am requesting that the CFPB take immediate action to investigate the following violations by XXXX and Equifax : Improper reporting of charge-offs and financial information without consumer consent. 

Failure to conduct proper investigations of disputed items, as required by the FCRA. 
Violation of privacy rights under the Right to Financial Privacy Act. 

Furthermore, I request that the CFPB ensure that both XXXX and Equifax : Permanently remove any unauthorized or inaccurate financial information from my credit reports.

Despite my initial dispute filed on XX/XX/XXXX, the inaccuracies remain unresolved, causing continued harm and distress. 
The following violations have occurred in relation to this reporting : 1. Inaccurate Reporting of Late Payments : The student loan accounts were incorrectly reported with late payments during a period when the accounts were in deferment status, as documented and verified by the US Department of Education ( documentation available upon request ). The accounts should reflect a current status with no late payments. Specifically, the following dates have been inaccurately reported as late payments : XX/XX/XXXX XX/XX/XXXX XX/XX/XXXX XX/XX/XXXX XX/XX/XXXX XXXX. Violation of Privacy and Unauthorized Reporting Under 15 USC 1681b, I retain the right to privacy regarding my personal financial information. Reporting these accounts with incorrect late payments without my consent constitutes a violation of my rights.

3. Failure to Maintain Accurate Reporting Under 15 USC 1681e ( b ), credit reporting agencies are required to maintain accurate and complete consumer files. By continuing to report these inaccuracies after my first dispute, the credit bureaus have failed in their obligations. 
Summary of Errors and Discrepancies : The errors include late payments being reported for months when the accounts were in deferment. Specifically, there are instances of 90- and 120-day late payments listed on my credit reports for TransUnion and XXXX , despite the loans being in deferment as verified by the US Department of Education . These discrepancies have severely impacted my credit score and financial reputation.

Requested Action : Given the severity of these violations and the documented deferment status of my loans, I am formally requesting the immediate correction of these accounts from my consumer reports within 10 calendar days from the receipt of this complaint. The requested corrections include removing all late payments and ensuring the accounts reflect a current status with no delinquencies. Failure to resolve this matter will result in further escalation. 
These inaccuracies have caused significant emotional distress and damage to my creditworthiness. I demand immediate corrective action to prevent further harm. I am prepared to provide additional documentation if needed.

I have a USDA loan and I was impacted financially by Covid and was offered CARES forbearance by the lender. I was assured by their agents that once I was back to work and ready to pay that the payments that were skipped would be put back into the loan and I could resume my original payment. However, when my hardship ended and I attempted to resume payments I was told that I had to go through a process to be approved for a plan to address the past due payments. No one told me that I had to be approved for a plan to address the past due payments, I was told not to worry about it, we will work something out once the pandemic ends and you are back at work. Due to these misrepresentations by Lakeview, I now find myself past due over {$65000.00} and in the beginning of the foreclosure process. I have been able to make my payment since XXXX but instead of working with me towards a resolution I have been stuck in an endless circus of document submission, document review, lost documents, additional information needed etc. This process is disorganized and grueling and each time took several months, and each time I tried to get this resolved I have been denied. I am told that the only resolution is full reinstatement of the past due amount of {$65000.00} which is not possible. Lakeview misled me as to how this program worked and have failed to follow the guidelines and have engaged in unethical servicing practices relating to my USDA loan My ex-husband XXXX and I purchased our home in XXXX with a USDA Loan. I have worked for the state of Connecticut in the Department of XXXX XXXX for 13 years. When the pandemic hit in spring of XXXX my income was impacted as my hours were cut and since my kids were out of school I also had to stay home periodically to help with that also. When I contacted Lakeview in XXXX XXXX I was told that I was approved for forbearance and the missed payments would get put onto the end of the loan once I was able to resume the payments. In early XXXX I contacted them and said I was back on my feet and wanted to resume payments but was told that I needed to go through a review to see if I qualify for recapitalization. This had never been mentioned before, that I needed to qualify. I was a single mother who was back to work and ready to pay but instead I had to turn in all of my financial information over and over again, an endless stream of documents sent, documents lost, documents outdated and multiple applications. This was very frustrating because I kept applying over and over and kept being told that I was denied for assistance options and that I needed to reinstate the past due balance. Since that time I have been trying to get help but feel that I am spinning my wheels as XXXX XXXX pushes me into foreclosure. 

My delinquency was due to XXXX and I was approved for the government backed CARES forbearance and Lakeview is required to give me the opportunity to go into a plan to address the past due amount. I have remarried and my new husband works and contributes to our income. My financial circumstances have significantly changed. Additionally I have 40 % of the arrearages amount set aside to submit as a good faith payment. USDA guidelines allow for the servicer to combine multiple programs in order to offer a solution and XXXX XXXX has failed to do so. If I brought in {$25000.00} towards the arrearages a portion of the loan could be deferred and a portion could be modified with the change in financial circumstances.

During a timeshare presentation, it is illegal for companies to mislead or deceive consumers with false promises or misleading information. 

Under XXXX law, particularly the Timeshare Resale Accountability Act and Federal Trade Commission ( FTC ) regulations, deceptive practices in the sale of timeshares are prohibited. These laws require that all marketing materials, contracts, and sales pitches be truthful and accurate. 
Any attempt to coerce, mislead, or misrepresent the benefits or terms of a timeshare agreement is a violation of consumer protection laws. 

Additionally, as consumers, we trust international companies selling timeshares or memberships to prioritize our safety, especially when purchasing property abroad. When we invest in timeshares, we do so with the expectation that the companies involved will take every measure to ensure a safe and secure environment for us to enjoy our vacations and investments. Unfortunately, recent developments have raised significant concerns about the safety of XXXX citizens traveling to XXXX. 
Between XXXX and XXXX, there was a disturbing increase in the number of murders ( over XXXX ) and violent crimes involving XXXX citizens in XXXX. 
These tragic events have understandably caused many consumers, like myself, to reconsider our decisions to purchase timeshare memberships in the region. 
As we weigh the risks, the rise in XXXX calls into question whether the companies offering timeshares are doing enough to ensure the security of their clients in an increasingly volatile environment. 
Given this situation, we as consumers XXXX find it necessary to reconsider or even seek to exit timeshare contracts. 

Reasons we are wanting to terminate this membership/timeshare agreement in addition to deceptive pitch and fraudulent/deceptive practices include : XXXX. Increased Safety Risks : The surge in XXXX against XXXX citizens in XXXX makes it difficult to justify vacationing or investing in properties located in areas where security is a growing concern. If the timeshare company can not guarantee a safe environment or provide enhanced security measures, clients XXXX no longer feel comfortable or secure using their membership. 
As a result, I urgeCFPB, FCC and like companies to hold international timeshare companies accountable. And, companies like XXXX to also protect XXXX citizens from companies like this. 


I further request that relevant communication be sent to my email regarding this debt. Again, the cease and desist was specifically around calling me about the debt. 

I will continue to challenge this debt as it was completely misleading, deceptive and fraudulent, purposely. It was the sole intent of XXXX to be deceptive to sell my family a membership that was indeed a timeshare.",Company believes it acted appropriately as authorized by contract or law,Monterey Financial Services LLC,IL,60620,,Consent provided,Web,2025-03-03,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,12294447

Despite my repeated efforts and the evidence I provided, Experian has neither corrected nor removed the disputed items, which remain inaccurate or unverifiable. This failure has negatively impacted my credit standing and caused ongoing financial harm.

Under 15 U.S.C. 1681i ( a ) ( 1 ) ( A ), Experian is required to conduct a reasonable reinvestigation of disputed information within 30 days. Additionally, 15 U.S.C. 1681e ( b ) mandates that credit reporting agencies ensure maximum possible accuracy in consumer credit files. Experians failure to properly investigate my disputes and its refusal to correct or remove inaccurate accounts constitute clear violations of these legal provisions.

Furthermore, I would like to bring attention to the recent CFPB lawsuit against Experian, which highlights systemic issues within its dispute resolution process. The lawsuit alleges that Experian has : 1. Failed to forward consumer-provided evidence to furnishers.

2. Accepted unreliable responses from furnishers without proper validation.

3. Failed to adequately notify consumers about the outcomes of their disputes.

These allegations mirror my experience. Experian has not properly reviewed or addressed the documentation I submitted, has failed to provide detailed explanations regarding its dispute resolutions, and has ultimately refused to take corrective action. This negligence continues to harm my financial standing, limiting my ability to obtain credit under fair terms.


Requested Action : I respectfully request that the CFPB take immediate action to : 1. Investigate Experians failure to comply with FCRA dispute resolution requirements. 2. Require Experian to correct or remove the disputed accounts from my credit report. 3. Ensure that Experian improves its dispute handling process to prevent further harm to consumers. Experians noncompliance with federal law has directly affected my financial stability, and I urge the CFPB to intervene promptly.

2025-02-13,Mortgage,FHA mortgage,Struggling to pay mortgage,Foreclosure,"I respectfully submit this urgent request for immediate intervention regarding ongoing and unlawful foreclosure proceedings against my property at XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XX/XX/XXXX IL XXXX, despite clear evidence that the mortgage debt has been fully satisfied. The imminent sale of my home is scheduled for XX/XX/XXXX, through XXXX, a sale that must be immediately stayed to prevent irreparable harm. 
I am the defendant in XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. XXXX, in Illinois, presided over by XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX of the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX. Additionally, I have filed XXXX XXXX XXXX. XXXX to address numerous violations of my constitutional rights and federal law. Despite the submission of a Bill of Exchange ( BOE ) on XX/XX/XXXX, which was recorded on my XXXX Financing Statement and privately served open ended GSA Bond to XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XX/XX/XXXX, to settle the foreclosure case, the court has failed to honor the BOE and GSA Bonds and continues to allow the foreclosure to proceed unlawfully. 
Factual Background On XX/XX/XXXX, I issued a Bill of Exchange ( BOE ) to the U.S. Treasury in satisfaction of the alleged mortgage debt associated with my property. This BOE was validly recorded on my XXXX Financing Statement, pursuant to the Uniform Commercial Code ( UCC ), which recognizes the BOE as a valid negotiable instrument under UCC 3-104 and 3-603. 
On XX/XX/XXXX, The GSA Bond was delivered in a private capacity toXX/XX/XXXXXX/XX/XXXX XXXX, who presides over the foreclosure case in XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Case No. XXXX, through XXXX, Manager of the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, who confirmed on video that he personally delivered the instrument to XX/XX/XXXXXXXX. 
Despite being given 90 days to respond and comply, XXXX XXXX has remained silent, which under UCC 3-501 ( a ) constitutes acceptance of the instrument. Instead of applying the BOE to discharge the debt, the court continues to pursue foreclosure proceedings. 
The GSA Bond was open-ended, allowing XXXX XXXX to input any amount necessary to fully satisfy and discharge the alleged debt. 

Despite being given 90 days to comply, XXXX XXXX has failed to apply the bond or acknowledge it in any manner, constituting tacit acquiescence and acceptance of the bond. 

Instead of resolving the matter, the foreclosure case has been allowed to proceed, and a foreclosure sale is scheduled for XX/XX/XXXX, which is now listed on XX/XX/XXXX 

The bonds purpose was to fully satisfy the debt, close the foreclosure case, and protect Petitioners home located at XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX, Illinois XXXX. 
Legal Arguments 1. Violation of Due Process U.S. Constitution, Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments The foreclosure proceedings have systematically denied me due process. My requests for discovery have been denied, my evidence has been ignored, and I have been prevented from presenting my case in a meaningful way. These actions violate my constitutional right to due process and fair treatment under the law. 
2. Uniform Commercial Code ( UCC ) Satisfaction and Discharge of Debt UCC 3-104 establishes that a Bill of Exchange is a negotiable instrument.

UCC 3-603 ( b ) mandates that once such an instrument is tendered and not refused within a reasonable time, the underlying obligation is discharged. Judge Sullivans failure to reject or acknowledge the BOE constitutes acceptance by silence.

UCC 3-501 ( a ) confirms that an instrument must be dishonored or accepted, but the judges silence and subsequent actions indicate unlawful retention without discharge of the debt.

3. Federal Consumer Protection Statutes Truth in Lending Act ( TILA ), 15 U.S.C. 1601 et seq. : Failure to provide validation of debt and misapplication of payments are violations of TILA.

Fair Debt Collection Practices Act ( FDCPA ), 15 U.S.C. 1692 : Continuation of collection efforts after payment and failure to verify the debt constitute deceptive and unfair practices.

28 U.S.C. 1331 Federal question jurisdiction exists as Petitioners claims arise under the Constitution and federal statutes.

28 U.S.C. 1343 Federal courts have authority to redress constitutional violations and grant equitable relief.

42 U.S.C. 1983 The state courts failure to honor the GSA Bond and the continued foreclosure proceedings constitute violations of Petitioners civil rights under color of state law.

4. Illinois Foreclosure Law Violations 735 ILCS 5/15-1508 ( d ) requires that foreclosure sales be fair and just. Proceeding with a sale while the debt has already been discharged violates this statute.

Illinois Consumer Fraud and Deceptive Business Practices Act, 815 ILCS 505/2 : The foreclosure proceedings represent unfair and deceptive practices.

5. Humanitarian and International Law The imminent eviction of my family of six without legal justification violates basic human rights as enshrined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights ( Articles 17 and 25 ), which guarantee the right to property and an adequate standard of living.

________________________________________ Relief Requested Given the urgency of this situation, I respectfully request that the CFPB : 1. Immediately halt the XX/XX/XXXX foreclosure sale of XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XX/XX/XXXX IL XXXX. 
2. Order XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX to acknowledge and account for the bond. 
3. Enforce the acceptance and application of the open-ended GSA Bond served on XX/XX/XXXX, to satisfy the alleged debt in Case No. XXXX. 
4. Conduct an investigation into the actions of XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and all other parties involved in this unlawful foreclosure. 
5. Enforce the application of the Bill of Exchange and confirm the discharge of the alleged debt.

6. Protect my family from homelessness and uphold our constitutional and human rights.

Conclusion I have exhausted all remedies available at the state level and am now at my last line of defense. This situation is urgent, and immediate intervention is required to prevent a miscarriage of justice.

2025-01-13,Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Struggling to pay mortgage,"Trying to communicate with the company to fix an issue related to modification, forbearance, short sale, deed-in-lieu, bankruptcy, or foreclosure","Subject : Mortgage Payment Error and Unfair Late Fees Complaint Summary : I recently discovered that my mortgage was placed in default due to a short payment, which I was unaware of for two months. Despite having paid a total of {$5900.00} by XXXX, the bank refused to apply my payments to the mortgage account because of a shortfall of {$580.00} in XXXX. This shortfall was related to the escrow account reserve for taxes, not the actual interest payment. The bank has now demanded {$24000.00} in late fees and refuses to accept further payments unless the late fees are paid in full. 

Details of the Issue : Payment Application Issue : By XXXX, I had already paid {$5900.00}. Even if my XXXX payment was short by {$580.00}, the payment should have been applied to the mortgage account. The unpaid amount was not related to interest but to the escrow account reserve for property taxes. Despite this, the bank treated the shortfall as if it was a missed mortgage payment and escalated the situation unnecessarily. If penalties were applied starting from XXXX based on a {$1300.00} shortfall ( from both XXXX and XXXX ), it is unreasonable to demand {$24000.00} in penalties for such a small deficit. 

Excessive Late Fees : A penalty of {$24000.00} for a shortfall of {$1300.00} is excessive and disproportionate. The penalty calculation appears arbitrary, and there has been no clear explanation or breakdown of how this amount was determined. 

Refusal to Accept Payments : The bank is refusing to accept further payments until the full penalty amount is paid. This has escalated the issue unnecessarily and has caused significant financial distress. 

Requested Resolution : Apply the {$5900.00} paid to the mortgage account and adjust or waive the excessive late fees. 
Allow me to resume regular payments to bring the mortgage current. 
Provide a detailed breakdown of how the {$24000.00} penalty was calculated and clarify why the escrow reserve shortfall was treated as a missed payment.

This dispute is submitted under the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), 15 U.S.C. 1681i, which requires credit reporting agencies to conduct a reasonable reinvestigation of disputed items. 

Recent findings by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ) have brought to light significant concerns regarding Experians failure to conduct proper investigations. Specifically, in a lawsuit filed against Experian, the CFPB alleges that the company engaged in sham investigations, violating consumer protection laws by failing to meet its obligations under the FCRA.

As per 15 U.S.C. 1681i ( a ) ( 1 ) ( A ) Experian is required to conduct a thorough and reasonable reinvestigation of disputed items within 30 days. Furthermore, under the 15 U.S.C. 1681i ( a ) ( 5 ), any information found to be inaccurate, incomplete, or unverifiable must be promptly deleted or corrected. Failure to adhere to these requirements constitutes a violation of federal law.

I hereby request that Experian : Conduct a thorough reinvestigation of the following disputed accounts or items Account name XXXX, Account number, XXXX. 
Provide me with all documentation to verify the accuracy of the disputed information. 
Correct or delete any information that can not be verified or is inaccurate, as mandated by law. 

Given the recent CFPB findings, I expect Experian to handle this dispute with the utmost seriousness and compliance with legal standards. A copy of my identification and any relevant supporting documents are enclosed to facilitate your investigation. 

If Experian fails to comply with its obligations under the FCRA, I will not hesitate to escalate this matter to the CFPB and pursue any necessary legal action to protect my rights. 

Please respond to this dispute in writing within the legally mandated time frame. I expect written confirmation of any changes made to my final credit file.

Legal Basis for Dispute 1. Inaccuracy of Reported Information Pursuant to 15 U.S.C. 1681b ( a ) ( 2 ), credit reporting agencies are required to ensure the accuracy and completeness of the information they report. Because the source of this information, XXXX, no longer maintains these records, Experian is reporting inaccurate and incomplete information by continuing to include these items on my credit report. 

2. Obligation to Remove Information FCRA 605 ( b ) ( 15 U.S.C. 1681c-2 ) requires the removal of inaccurate items from the credit report within 4 days of a dispute being submitted. Given that these records are demonstrably inaccurate, Experian 's failure to promptly remove them violates this statutory obligation.

3. Willful Noncompliance Under 15 U.S.C. 1681n, Experian is liable for willful noncompliance with the FCRA. This includes failing to conduct a reasonable investigation into the accuracy of the disputed items and failing to act in accordance with the law to ensure only verified and accurate information remains on my credit report. 

Demand for Resolution I demand that the following actions be taken immediately : The removal of XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX ( Account Number : XXXX ) from my Experian credit report within the time frame required by FCRA 605 ( b ).

2025-01-27,Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Trouble during payment process,Private mortgage insurance (PMI),I purchased a home in XXXX of XXXX and sold my current home. Once my current home sold I applied the funds received toward my new mortgage in the form of a recast to lower my payment and remove the PMI. My mortgage has been sold and transferred to different servicing agencies more than once. My original loan servicer agreed to remove the PMI and lowered my payment. My loan was transferred to another servicing company and the PMI was still being taken from my escrow account. I called and they agreed to remove the PMI again and lowered my payment. I also sent a letter asking for an investigation into my account for all the hassle it took for me to have this simple process done after calling multiple times without success. They sent a letter stating they received my letter and would look into it. I received another letter asking for more time to investigate. I have been transferred multiple times and have a hard time speaking to a supervisor. I received a letter recently stating my loan was being transferred to another servicing company as of XX/XX/XXXX. I called today and was on the phone for two hours with no success on the refund to my escrow of the PMI that was taken in error. One service agent admitted she saw a note in my account that the escrow was taken in error and was going to be refunded. She said the note was from XXXX but it said that it was in process still. She told me I need to speak with the insurance department. The insurance department said I needed to speak with customer service. I was transferred to customer service and the young man would not listen to me and was talking over me. I asked for a supervisor and she did the same although I am not certain she was actually a supervisor. I asked for a call from a supervisor and she said if the dont call in the next couple days to just call back. It is extremely difficult to get a service agent on the line so this is very frustrating after two hours on the phone with no success. My loan will service will change again as of XX/XX/XXXX and I am afraid I will need to still fight with the new company. My escrow will be short from this error because they lowered the payment twice. One from the old company and one with this company but still took the PMI payments from the escrow. Most agents I talk to are rude and will not help. I ask for a supervisor and am told I will have to wait for a call and if they dont call to call again. Calling and trying to get an agent is almost impossible as the phone system does not work correctly. I am beyond frustrated at this point and need help with this issue.,Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,"Shellpoint Partners, LLC",TX,77904,,Consent provided,Web,2025-01-27,Closed with monetary relief,Yes,N/A,11799944

Specifically, I would like to outline the issues I am experiencing : 1. Numerous unauthorized inquiries that I did not authorize.

2. Variations of my name that do not accurately reflect my legal name.

3. Outdated addresses that should no longer be associated with my credit report.

I believe that these errors may be contributing to a negative impact on my credit score and overall financial history. I kindly request your support in facilitating the correction of these inaccuracies and in assisting me with the removal of the unauthorized inquiries.

Enclosed are copies of the relevant documentation I have previously sent to the credit reporting agencies, as well as copies of my credit report highlighting the discrepancies.

Thank you for your attention to this matter.

The account in question was a charge-off of {$700.00} from XXXX XXXX XXXX that I disputed, and as of XX/XX/year>, XXXX has completed their investigation and removed the account entirely from my report. 
Under the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), I have the right to dispute inaccurate information on my credit report. Since XXXX has deleted this account due to its unverifiability, I am requesting that you also remove this account from my credit report. The deletion by XXXX indicates that the account is no longer verified, and thus, under Section 607 ( b ) of the FCRA, you are required to ensure that the information you report is accurate and complete. Also Fair Credit Reporting Act ( 15 U.S.C. 1681.

I encourage you to take action within 30 days to remove this unverifiable account from my credit report. Failure to do so may violate the FCRA and could result in legal action. Under Section 616 of the FCRA, I have the right to seek damages if you willfully fail to comply with the law.

On XX/XX/year>, I disputed the reporting of my XXXX XXXX  account, citing incorrect payment information. Within less than 10 hours, Experian issued a response acknowledging that the account was inaccurately reported but stated that it would not be removed or corrected.

The response provided by Experian reads as follows : The incorrect account with XXXX XXXX  that starts with XXXX has not been changed and will remain on your credit report. 

This swift response strongly suggests that Experian did not conduct a thorough investigation, as required under the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ). Specifically : 1. Failure to Conduct a Reasonable Investigation ( FCRA Section 611 ( a ) ) : Experians response timeframe raises concerns about whether XXXX XXXX  was contacted to verify the reported information.

The account has already been acknowledged as containing errors, yet Experian has refused to correct or remove the inaccuracies.

2. Failure to Correct or Delete Inaccurate Information ( FCRA Section 623 ( b ) ) : By law, credit reporting agencies must delete or correct inaccurate information if it can not be verified as accurate.

Actions Requested : I respectfully request the CFPBs assistance in ensuring Experian complies with the FCRA by : 1. Conducting a proper investigation into this accounts payment reporting errors.

2. Providing clear and verifiable documentation from XXXX XXXX to substantiate the payment history.

3. Correcting or removing the account from my credit report if it can not be verified as accurate and complete.

Supporting Documentation : A copy of Experians response ( Report Number : XXXX ). 
A copy of my credit report showing the disputed account and errors.

Desired Outcome : I request that the CFPB hold Experian accountable for its obligations under the FCRA and ensure that this matter is resolved promptly. Experians failure to address this issue impacts my creditworthiness and creates unnecessary financial hardship.

Sharing my information with consumer reporting agencies without my explicit consent constitutes an infringement on my rights under the Privacy Act of 1974, Section 3-202. 

I have never conducted business with nor entered into any contractual agreement with LVNV FUNDING LLC. Consequently, any claim against me by this entity is without merit. Furthermore, transferring a security or obligation does not confer rights to the transferee that supersede those of the original creditor. Under Uniform Commercial Code ( UCC ) Section 3-203, the rights of enforcement are limited to the transferor and do not extend to third parties unless certain legal conditions are met : Instrument Transfer : According to UCC 3-203 ( a ), an instrument is considered transferred only when it is delivered by a party other than its issuer for enforcement purposes.

Transferee Rights : Per UCC 3-203 ( b ), the transferee acquires only the rights held by the transferor and can not attain holder-in-due-course status if fraud or illegality is involved. 

Endorsement Requirements : UCC 3-203 ( c ) specifies that a transferee must have a specifically enforceable right to the transferor 's endorsement, and negotiation is incomplete without such endorsement. 

Partial Transfers : UCC 3-203 ( d ) states that a transferee of less than the entire instrument has no enforceable rights under the UCC and holds only partial assignment rights. 

Based on the aforementioned statutes, LVNV FUNDING LLC has no legal standing to pursue or report any obligations tied to my name. I demand the immediate removal of any information related to this matter from my credit file and confirmation of this action in writing within 15 days. 

Failure to comply with this request will compel me to file complaints with the Federal Trade Commission ( FTC ) and other relevant authorities. Additionally, I reserve the right to pursue legal action for any damages arising from the unauthorized use of my information.

Under the provisions of 15 U.S.C. 1681i, I request a thorough investigation and prompt resolution of the following issues. Specifically, I believe the credit reporting agency has failed to conduct an adequate investigation within the 30-day timeframe required under the law, and as such, this may constitute negligence in compliance with your legal obligations. 

I kindly request the following actions be taken immediately : Correction or Deletion of Inaccurate Information : Based on my records, the information provided is incorrect. I request that this information be corrected or removed from my credit report as required by the FCRA.

I recently reviewed my credit report and found incorrect information regarding my Capital One account. I request that this error be investigated and corrected promptly. 

Specifically, the following information is inaccurate : XXXX XXXX : My credit report states that this account was charged off. However, this is incorrect as the account was either paid in full or settled. I request verification and proper correction of this status. 

Payment History : The report inaccurately shows past due payments for multiple months. This is incorrect because payments were either made on time or not applicable due to account closure. Please provide detailed verification or correct this section to reflect accurate reporting. 

High Balance and Credit Limit Discrepancies : The reported high balance of {$560.00} and credit limit of {$500.00} from XX/XX/XXXX do not align with my records. Kindly provide documentation substantiating these amounts or adjust them accordingly. 

As required by the FCRA, I request that the inaccurate information be investigated and either corrected or removed. Please provide me with written confirmation once the necessary changes have been made. If you require further details, I am happy to provide supporting documentation upon request. 

Additionally, I request that you send me an updated copy of my credit report reflecting these corrections.

I made a {$500.00} down payment, and the original loan amount was {$20000.00}, with a high annual percentage rate ( APR ) of 21.84 %. My monthly payment is {$510.00}.

When I contacted Santander Consumer USA to inquire about refinancing or modifying the loan to make the payments more manageable, I was told that refinancing was not an option through them. This has left me with no ability to adjust the terms of my loan despite the financial burden caused by the high interest rate and the gap between the loan balance and the vehicles value. 

I believe the loan terms were predatory, as the excessive interest rate and risk of negative equity were not adequately explained at the time of purchase.

2025-01-28,Credit reporting or other personal consumer reports,Credit reporting,Problem with a company's investigation into an existing problem,Their investigation did not fix an error on your report,"I am writing to formally dispute the inaccurate and misleading information contained in my credit report, as well as to address your companys failure to comply with federal consumer protection laws. This dispute is in direct reference to the recent enforcement action taken by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ) against Experian for engaging in sham investigations and failing to properly address consumer disputes.

It is unacceptable that Experian, as one of the largest credit reporting agencies, continues to violate the rights of consumers under federal law. I demand that you immediately investigate and correct the inaccuracies in my credit report and provide a detailed explanation of your findings. Failure to do so will result in further action, including filing a complaint with the CFPB and pursuing legal remedies.

Below, I cite three key federal laws under **15 U.S.C . ** that Experian is legally obligated to comply with : 1. **15 U.S.C. 1681c Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), Section 605** This section mandates that outdated and inaccurate information must not be included in consumer credit reports. Experians failure to remove or correct such information violates this provision and harms my creditworthiness.

2. **15 U.S.C. 1681e Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), Section 607** This section requires credit reporting agencies to follow reasonable procedures to ensure maximum possible accuracy of the information in consumer reports. Experians sham investigations and failure to properly address disputes demonstrate a blatant disregard for this legal obligation.

3. **15 U.S.C. 1681i Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), Section 611** This section requires credit reporting agencies to conduct a reasonable reinvestigation of disputed information within 30 days of receiving a dispute. Experians pattern of conducting inadequate or sham investigations, as highlighted by the CFPBs enforcement action, is a clear violation of this law.

I demand that Experian : 1. Conduct a thorough and lawful reinvestigation of all disputed items on my credit report.

2. Provide me with written confirmation of the results of the reinvestigation, including any corrections made.

3. Remove any inaccurate, incomplete, or unverifiable information from my credit report.

4. Cease any practices that violate federal consumer protection laws, including sham investigations.

If Experian fails to comply with these demands within 30 days of receiving this, I will have no choice but to escalate this matter by pursuing legal action under the FCRA. I will also seek damages for any harm caused to my creditworthiness and financial well-being as a result of Experians negligence and noncompliance.

I believe these late payments are erroneous and do not accurately reflect my payment history. 

Account name : XXXX XXXX Account number XXXX Nature of the Complaint : 1. Inaccurate Reporting : The late payments listed on my credit report are inaccurate. I have consistently made my payments on time, as I have been enrolled in autopay for all my accounts.

2. Violation of the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) : The inaccurate reporting of these late payments violates my rights under the FC

RA ( 15 USC 1666 ( b ) ), as they misrepresent my creditworthiness. 3. Potential Violation of Fair Debt Collections Practices Act ( FDCPA ) : The r
eporting of false late payments may also constitute a violation of the FDCPA, which protects consumers from misrepresentation regarding their accounts.

4. Truth in Lending Act ( TILA ) : I assert that the reporting practices violate the TILA, which mandates accurate reporting of credit information.

Additionally, the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), specifically sections 15 U.S. Code 1681i and 15 U.S. Code 1681s-2, mandates that credit reporting agencies and information furnishers correct any inaccurate or incomplete information in credit reports and ensure the maximum accuracy of information contained in consumer files.

Furthermore, under the FCRA, articles 616 and 617 ( 15 U.S.C. 1681n and 1681o ) outline the civil liability for willful and negligent noncompliance, respectively. These provisions provide for damages, including actual damages, attorneys fees, and possible punitive damages, for failure to comply with the Act 's requirements.

Requested Resolution : I request that Experian conduct a thorough investigation into this matter and remove the inaccurate late payments from my credit report. I ask that all such entries be updated to reflect my true payment history of 100 % on-time payments.

I expect to receive written documentation confirming the removal of these entries within 30 days of this complaint submission. Failure to resolve this issue may lead to further action to protect my rights as a consumer.

I have recently reviewed my credit report and identified several hard inquiries that I believe were made in violation of my rights, and I seek your intervention in addressing these issues. The following items I would like to have removed : XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX According to the FCRA ( Section 604 ), a credit inquiry is considered "" hard '' when it is made as a result of a credit application, loan request, or any other action that may impact my credit score. Under the FCRA, these inquiries should only be recorded if I have authorized them. Unfortunately, I believe some of the inquiries on my credit report were made without my explicit permission or were based on incomplete or inaccurate information. 

In particular, I would like to highlight the following reasons for my request : Lack of Authorization : There are hard inquiries on my credit report that I do not recall authorizing. If these inquiries were made without my consent, they violate my rights under the FCRA. 

Inaccurate Reporting : Some of the inquiries on my credit report may be inaccurate, as I did not apply for credit with the entities listed, or the inquiries may have been made in error. As per CFPB regulations, credit reporting agencies are required to ensure the accuracy of information contained within credit reports ( 15 U.S.C. 1681e ( b ) ).

Time Frame for Removal : Hard inquiries must be removed from a credit report after two years, but the inquiry may no longer be relevant to my credit score after the first year. I request that any outdated inquiries be removed as per CFPB regulations for data accuracy and fairness. 

Under the Fair Credit Reporting Act, I understand that I have the right to dispute any inaccuracies on my credit report directly with the credit bureaus. However, due to the circumstances surrounding these inquiries and the fact that they are affecting my creditworthiness, I request that you investigate this matter thoroughly and remove any unauthorized or incorrect hard inquiries from my report in accordance with federal law. 

Please let me know if additional documentation or information is needed to support my request. I would greatly appreciate your prompt attention to this matter and look forward to your response.

The fraudster tells the member they will receive a text containing details of a XXXX transfer and I must authorize the transaction under the guise that it is for reversing the fraudulent debit card transaction ( s ).

In doing so, {$1000.00} was transferred to a "" XXXX XXXX. '' The XXXX XXXX is shown as complete.

While in route to my bank at the branch addressed mentioned above I realized this was a fraudster/scammer as I tried to call the number back which is indeed a accurate number given it is inputted in my contacts when I do in fact call PNC Bank ( please refer to the attachment of call log activity of when the scammer called-approximately time XXXX length of call XXXX minutes and XXXX seconds ).

XXXX XXXX had worked to close out my original debit card and provided me with a new card and pin number. She advised me to log into my online banking account and change my password which I complied. She insisted that she could not stop the {$1000.00} transaction as it had not posted to my account which I did not understand given I had immediately warned the financial institution while the transaction was still pending. I thought being proactive opposed to reactive would remedy the situation along with having to work to change my debit card information. 

XXXX XXXX insisted that I contact the bank tomorrow morning Saturday XX/XX/XXXX at the number on the back of my card the same number where all this fraudulent activity began XXXX to inquire if the transaction had posted in order to dispute it. I really did not feel comfortable, was uneasy, and untrusting. With {$1000.00} being removed from my account I needed answers immediately.

I contacted XXXX directly at XXXX at approximately XXXX today for a duration of XXXX minutes and XXXX seconds ( see attached call log ). XXXX stated that they could not assist as the matter needed to be resolved with PNC Bank directly. 

I have never been involved any fraudulent behavior as such.

I have to put my faith in the hands of others to hopefully pray that all of my funds can be recovered. It should be noted that I filed a complaint with the Federal Trade Commission ( please refer to attachment ) for this matter.

2025-01-14,Credit reporting or other personal consumer reports,Credit reporting,Incorrect information on your report,Account information incorrect,""" The Fair Credit Reporting Act ( 15 U.S. Code 1681 ) says ( 1 ) The banking system is dependent upon fair and accurate credit reporting. Inaccurate credit reports directly impair the efficiency of the banking system, and unfair credit reporting methods undermine the public confidence which is essential to the continued functioning of the banking system. 

So whenever there is a violation under the FCRA, it impairs the efficiency of the banking system. This is a violation of TILA US Code 1666B since I was never late. 

I recently reviewed my consumer report and noticed an incorrect late payment record on my XXXX Bank account [ XXXX ]. I have always maintained timely payments on this account. Under the Fair Credit Billing Act ( FCBA ) and the Truth in Lending Act ( TILA ), creditors are required to accurately report consumer transactions and provide a mechanism for correcting errors in a timely manner. Please conduct an investigation into this matter, and if you can not provide documentary evidence of these supposed late payments, I demand these payments to be updated to on time as they should be as I was NEVER late. I expect these updates to be made promptly, in compliance with the law.

XX/XX/XXXX, Mr. Cooper 's bankruptcy 's dept rep specificly told me they do not object to receiving fund from the XXXX program or any HAF programs and asked me to obtain a letter from my bankruptcy attorney agreeing to their participation of the XXXX program, to support Mr. Cooper 's acceptance of the XXXX program. Mr. Cooper promised to correct their error by sending a letter to XXXX specificly stating that they "" did not '' object to the XXXX program and will participate with receiving funds. 

I regularly sent emails and follow up calls during ( XXXX XXXX ) to ensure that Mr. Cooper made good on their promise to remediate their error. Unfortunately I was disappointed to know that the specific letter Mr. Cooper promised to send was never sent to XXXX and XXXX stated that as of XX/XX/XXXX, I was denied the XXXX program because Mr. Cooper failed to send XXXX the coorespondance to overturn the objection that was inadvertently was sent error, as promised to me. ( recorded calls are available ) As of today Mr. Cooper has stated that they are trying to remediate the problem they created in XXXX and that I am now to contact XXXX not Mr. Cooper for status on the XXXX status. 

Mr. Cooper 's negligence, admitted error, failure to resolve timely ( timeline XXXX - XXXX ), and significant impact to jeopardizing my receipt of state assistance during my hardship is unacceptable, I also believe their actions maybe discriminatory and the process has been extremely exhausting and stressful for me and my family. 

I am requesting an investigation of Mr. Cooper 's actions and remediation with a desired outcome to compensate me the amount of funds I would receive from the XXXX program as described in the "" XXXX XXXX XXXX '' as listed above. 

I must state that I have spoken with over 10 representatives over the past 5 months from Mr. Cooper all on recorded lines and have also sent written correspondence. All have confirmation that Mr. Cooper never objected to my participation in the XXXX program and they would resolve within 7 days. 

Everytime I would ask a rep when would the letter confirming Mr. Cooper 's participation/acceptance would be sent to XXXX, to resolve Mr. Cooper 's error the response was always "" a letter will be sent within 7 days. '' I have been told that a letter will be sent within 7 days since XX/XX/XXXX. I have diligently followed with Mr. Cooper and XXXX up every 2 weeks since then. I am now being told to just wait and follow up with NJFMA with questions regarding the XXXX decision. This is unfair because the XXXX decision is based on the service 's response. 

How can this be when the error was with Mr. Cooper. More importantly I am very concerned that I am in jeopardy of loosing my XXXX XXXX and Mr. Cooper is demonstrating unfair Mortgage practice. 

Your assistance would be greatly appreciated.

Upon reviewing my reports, I noticed a significant error related to my CBNA account ( Account Number XXXX ). 
Specific Inaccuracy : The report states that the account was charged off with a past due amount of {$6100.00} as of XX/XX/XXXX and a balance of {$6100.00} updated as of XX/XX/XXXX. However, there is a clear inconsistency in the payment history section : 1. The payment history shows multiple charge-offs ( CO ) reported consecutively for several months in XXXX and XXXX. According to the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), a charge-off can only be reported once and should not appear as a recurring event. Reporting a charge-off for multiple months is factually incorrect. 
2. Additionally, the payment history indicates a 30-day and 60-day late payment for XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX after the account was already reported as charged off in previous months. Once an account is charged off, it can not have additional late payments reported. This is a clear violation of accurate reporting standards under the FCRA. 
Requested Actions : 1. Reinvestigate this account information with CBNA to verify its accuracy.

2. Correct the status of the account by removing the repeated charge-off entries and the inaccurate late payments if they are indeed errors, or provide supporting documentation validating the reported information.

3. Update my credit reports accordingly and send me corrected copies. 
Please consider this letter as a formal dispute under the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ). I have attached a copy of my credit report highlighting the inaccurate information for your reference and request that XXXX and XXXX also verify the accuracy of this account. 
I would appreciate your prompt attention to this matter and a response within 30 days of receiving this letter. Should you need any further information to complete the investigation, please contact me directly at the phone number or email listed above.

As per the regulations outlined in UCC 1681a and the Bill of Exchange Act, such denial goes against the Truth in Lending Act and raises serious questions about fair and transparent lending practices.

I wish to highlight that as a consumer, I have the right to credit as per the provisions of the Bill of Exchange Act. It is imperative that you adhere to the legal framework governing credit transactions and ensure that my rights are respected in this regard.

I am deeply troubled by the denial of credit and the lack of proper justification provided for this decision.

I urge you to promptly investigate this matter and provide me with the required documentation and details related to the credit denial. You have a period of ten days to respond and resolve this credit transaction in compliance with the relevant laws and regulations.

Furthermore, I request that you resolve this matter by promptly sending me the perks or benefits that were promised to me as part of the transaction that took place. It is imperative that you honor your commitments and fulfill the terms of the agreement made with me as a consumer.

I expect a swift and satisfactory resolution to this matter, and I trust that you will take the necessary actions to address this issue promptly.

Nature of the Dispute Experian is incorrectly reporting my XXXX XXXX XXXX account as "" Charged Off as Bad Debt '' with a past-due balance of {$16000.00}, despite XXXX correctly reporting the same account as open and paid as agreed with no charge-off status. This reporting is materially inaccurate and damaging to my creditworthiness. 

Violations of the FCRA Violation of FCRA 1681e ( b ) Failure to Maintain Maximum Possible Accuracy : Experian failed to ensure the accuracy of the information it is reporting by misclassifying an active, open account as charged off.

Violation of FCRA 1681s-2 ( b ) Failure to Update Information After Dispute : XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX  ( the furnisher ) is also responsible for correcting inaccurate data once notified of a dispute.

Initially, I received an email confirming the delivery of the eGift Cards, but I encountered significant difficulty in accessing the card details.

The details appeared to be restricted for security reasons. While I can appreciate the necessity of stringent security measures, the process was unnecessarily cumbersome and frustrating. 

Unfortunately, a far more serious issue emerged after obtaining the card details. When attempting to use these eGift Cards for online shopping, I discovered that many merchants declined them or expressed uncertainty regarding their validity. In several instances, transactions were outright rejected, either due to the merchants ' inability to verify my rightful ownership or for unspecified reasons. 

As a consumer, my primary motivation for purchasing these prepaid eGift Cards was to enjoy the convenience, portability, and security they are supposed to offer. However, these benefits have been completely overshadowed by the cards ' impracticality.

2024-04-09,Credit card,General-purpose credit card or charge card,Closing your account,Company closed your account,"The complaint is with Capital One. In several instances in my dealings with them, they did not perform and violated several consumer laws. I had XXXX credit card accounts with them and I contacted them with billing concerns and formally lodged a billing dispute complaint. I sent the first letter to them on XX/XX/XXXX and then again on XX/XX/XXXX. They did not respond to either of the disputes within 30 days as the law states and made no attempts to investigate the matter. My complaints were about 15 USC 1666b and 1666d. They did not abide by these laws in how my account was handled and how they reported my activity. 

After several conversations with the various departments they sitll didnt even acknowledge the fact that I had in good faith submitted billing disputes on both of my accounts. Ultimately they wound up closing both of my accounts citing a violation of the cardholder agreement. They told me that they do not accept the form of payment I sent in. I sent them a registered security to satisfy payment and a security is a lawfull form of payment. When calling them and asking me to send them in writing that they do not accept securities ( commercial paper bonds ) as payment, they hung up on me several times. Finally, after calling back several times, they blatantly told me that they could not send me that information in writing. It was enough of a reason for them to close my accounts but they absolutely would not send me it in writing. My last communication with them was on XXXX, XXXX 2024 at around noon CST, on several recorded lines and this is where they told me they couldn't send me this information in writing. 

The reason why they would not send me the information in writing is because it backs up my stance in the disputes with them and also because they are committing securities fraud and evading paying taxes on the proceeds from those securities. They take their receivables, securitize them in a trust, and then trade them on the primary and secondary markets where they do not have to be registered for a few different reasons. First, they are a foreign limited liability company that doesn't have to register securities and secondly, they get securitized as commercial paper which also does not have to be registered, if they are not registered you can surely believe they are not paying taxes on them. This is the reason they refuse to send me the information I requested in writing. In their purchase, pooling and servicing, security and indenture agreement, it states that they do not and will not engage in any fraudulent practices when it comes to their investors and their handling of securities and then they evade obligation or liability by refusing to provide documentation when requested to an investor who feels that they are being used to commit the fraud.",,CAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATION,IA,528XX,,Consent provided,Web,2024-04-09,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,8736360

Moving on, i contacted the collection ageny that they made a mistake but XXXX thing about collection agencies is that they dont care at all they just want money, they are asking me to pay {$2000.00} plus, and they also said they put a lean on my home title. i think this is pure wickedness and evil. so please i need your help because i do not owe the collection agency, my HOA office is who i owe. here is the collection agency XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX phone number : XXXX",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,"Alliance CAS, LLC",GA,30126,,Consent provided,Web,2025-01-18,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,11368434

This account is being falsely reported as a charge-off and collection account, which is completely inaccurate, misleading, and unverifiable under the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ). 

The details of the erroneous account are as follows : Creditor Name : XXXX XXXX XXXX Account Status : Charged Off / Collection Balance Reported : {$34000.00} Remarks : Charged-off account, auto loan, first payment never received This account is incorrect and should be removed immediately for the following reasons : XXXX. Inaccurate Balance & Status The reported balance and past-due amounts are inconsistent and unverifiable. I demand strict validation of the exact amount owed, including all supporting documents. If XXXX XXXX XXXX can not verify this, the account must be removed. 
XXXX. Failure to Notify I was never properly notified regarding this alleged charge-off, which is a direct violation of my rights under the FCRA. 
XXXX. Unlawful Reporting of First Payment Issue The remarks claim that the first payment was never received, which suggests an issue with the lender, not my responsibility. Reporting this as a charge-off is unfair and misleading. 
XXXX. Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) Violation As per XXXX U.S.C. XXXX, all reported information must be 100 % accurate, verifiable, and timely. If the credit bureaus fail to validate this account with complete documentation, including original creditor agreements, payment history, and legal proof of charge-off, this entry must be deleted immediately. 

I demand that this account be fully investigated and removed from my credit report within 30 days as required by law. Failure to comply will result in formal complaints being filed with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ), the Federal Trade Commission ( FTC ), and my states Attorney Generals office for willful non-compliance with federal laws. 

Please respond in writing to confirm that this account has been removed or provide legal proof of its validity. If no response is received within the legally required time frame, I will assume that the account is unverifiable and must be permanently deleted.

2017-01-24,Student loan,Non-federal student loan,Dealing with my lender or servicer,Received bad information about my loan,"I have been consistently misled and kept in the dark about the process of my repayment and deferment. I called XXXX on around XXXX XXXX XXXX, and was told that I would be out of deferment and able to begin repaying my loans, waving my rights for the grace period. Because of usurious interest rates of XXXX and other student lenders, I accepted. The period in which I was to wait to enter repayment lapsed, and I was not notified and remained unable to begin repayment, which I needed to refinance my loans. I called XXXX to be told I was not going to be taken out of deferment, but instead would need to send a letter to request to forego the grace period and deferment in order to begin repayment. In the meantime, I accrued interest at usurious rates. 

The same story happened at Discover. I called on XXXX XXXX XXXX, and was told I needed to send a letter to Discover Student Lending services to remain out of deferment because "" the system fluctuates and takes people out of deferment. '' No changes on my account occurred, and I called back roughly 10 days later ( accruing well over {$100.00} in interest over that period, over {$100.00} in seven days, to be specific ). When I called to inquire about this, I was told they were waiting to take me out ( two business days after the 5 business day period I was told ) of deferment. I was told in that phone call contradictory information, i.e., that I did not need to send a letter. I called on the following Monday, and was told I did need to send a letter, and that I had n't been given false information. I was under the impression that this would be a personal letter, as the first representative stated. The representative did n't state otherwise and offered no specifics. I later called back to get specifics, only to be told to "" hold '' while the representative "" researched '' the policy. She returned to the phone to tell me that I needed a letter from my university requesting to forego my grace period and deferment and enter repayment. This seemed odd, given the substance of the first and second representatives ' information. I requested to speak with a supervisor, who then told me I did need to send a letter -- he later informed me of the upload feature, but only after I mentioned a lawyer. No other representative offered knowledge of an immediate upload feature. US mail would have taken additional time, and additional interest. Anyway, this supervisor told me I needed to send a personal letter -- not a letter from my university -- in order to forego grace period and deferment. I asked, "" This is the fifth person I 've spoken to, and the fifth type and level of asymmetry of information I 've received. '' He said, "" It 's on the website. '' I said, "" Show me. '' He could n't, and after a brief hold, returned to tell me "" it 's not on the website. '' I said, "" Interesting. '' I then asked about the interest I 'd accrued during this week and a half run around. He misrepresented that amount, and said, "" It would be 'dollars. ' '' I said, "" How many 'dollars? ' '' His rejoinder : "" over {$100.00}. '' I accrued over {$100.00} additional dollars in interest in "" seven days, '' while they misled me and fed me false information. They did the same for four years, leading us to believe -- without any notifications -- that we would n't be accruing significant interest, burying the transparent amount over the course of years ( again, without even a courtesy call to let me know the amount I 'd accrued ). I had accrued {$30000.00} in 4 years while working toward a XXXX. 

Example of the lack of transparency in this period of interest accrual? I called in XXXX of XXXX, and in XXXX XXXX.

Dispute Department RE : Formal Dispute of Inaccurate Credit Reporting under FCRA and Consumer Law To Whom It May Concern, I am writing to formally dispute inaccurate information on my credit report. This dispute is submitted under the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), 15 U.S.C. 1681i, which requires credit reporting agencies to conduct a reasonable reinvestigation of disputed items. 
Recent findings by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ) have brought to light significant concerns regarding Experian 's failure to conduct proper investigations. Specifically, in a lawsuit filed against Experian, the CFPB alleges that the company engaged in sham investigations, violating consumer protection laws by failing to meet its obligations under the FCRA. 
As per 15 U.S.C. 1681i ( a ) ( 1 ) ( A ), Experian is required to conduct a thorough and reasonable reinvestigation of disputed items within 30 days. Furthermore, under 15 U.S.C. 1681i ( a ) ( 5 ), any information found to be inaccurate, incomplete, or unverifiable must be promptly deleted or corrected. Failure to adhere to these requirements constitutes a violation of federal law.

I hereby request that Experian : 1. Conduct a thorough reinvestigation of the following disputed accounts or items [ list the specific accounts or items you are disputing ].

2. Provide me with all documentation used to verify the accuracy of the disputed information.

3. Correct or delete any information that can not be verified or is inaccurate, as mandated by law. 
Given the recent CFPB findings, I expect Experian to handle this dispute with the utmost seriousness and compliance with legal standards. A copy of my identification and any relevant supporting documents are enclosed to facilitate your investigation. 
If Experian fails to comply with its obligations under the FCRA, I will not hesitate to escalate this matter to the CFPB and pursue any necessary legal action to protect my rights. 
Please respond to this dispute in writing within the legally mandated timeframe. I expect written confirmation of any changes made to my credit file.

After disputing a collection account reported by this entity, I discovered that no proper investigation was conducted. Instead, the account was updated to include a past-due balance, inaccurately reflecting the account as open and actively delinquent. 

This reporting practice is inconsistent with FCRA requirements and legal precedents that emphasize the accuracy and completeness of credit reporting. 

Details of the Issue XXXX. Account Information : XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX accounts, same number listed on my report, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  XXXX : Date of my original dispute : XX/XX/XXXX Date of response/update : XX/XX/XXXX XXXX. Violation of FCRA and XXXX XXXX XXXX : FCRA XXXX XXXX ( b ) : This section mandates that furnishers of information ( creditors and collection agencies ) conduct a proper investigation upon receiving a consumer dispute. Updating the account with incorrect information without investigating violates this provision. 
FTC Advisory Opinion ( XX/XX/XXXX ) : The Federal Trade Commission ( FTC ) has noted that collection accounts are not open accounts and, therefore, should not reflect ongoing past due balances. Reporting such balances misrepresents the nature of the account and creates a misleading credit profile. 

Relevant Legal Precedents XXXX. XXXX v. XXXX XXXX, XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX. XXXX XXXX ( S.D. Iowa XXXX ) : This case highlights that reporting inaccurate or misleading information about a consumers credit violates the FCRA and creates actionable harm. 
XXXX. XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX XXXX  XXXX ) : The court ruled that creditors and furnishers must ensure the accuracy of reported information and investigate disputes thoroughly. Failing to do so can result in liability under the FCRA. 
XXXX. XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX ) : This case established that credit reporting agencies and furnishers must take reasonable steps to ensure the accuracy of their information. 

Request for Resolution I respectfully request the following : 1. Immediate removal as it does not align with the nature of a collection account.

Supporting Documents I have attached copies of the following : Response received from the collection agency/credit bureau Copies of my credit report showing the inaccurate reporting.

Impact on Me This inaccurate and misleading reporting has caused unnecessary damage to my credit score, hindering my ability to refinance my mortgage.

I trust the CFPB will take appropriate action to ensure compliance with FCRA regulations and address this issue. I also request that the CFPB investigate the practice of reporting past-due balances on collection accounts, which is inherently misleading and not reflective of their closed status. 

Thank you for your time and attention. I look forward to your response.

2019-02-18,Student loan,Federal student loan servicing,Struggling to repay your loan,Problem lowering your monthly payments,"Back in XXXX I was XXXX years old and remember being very diligent about my finances and accruing student debts. I applied for as many scholarships and grants that I could qualify for with the hope of receiving as much financial assistance that I could to utilize towards furthering my education. In XXXX I enrolled in the University XXXX XXXX XXXX where I finished my XXXX XXXX. I did this because while attending that school the tuition was roughly half that of the main campus at the University XXXX XXXX. I did all of these laborious tasks to cut down my costs for higher education. After receiving my XXXX  degree and not being able to afford to repay my student loans, I called your organization to hear my options and ask for assistance. I signed up for the deferment plan versus an income based repayment plan because the representatives stated that deferment would be the best option for me based on my financial situation. I feel as though I was mislead by not being advised to utilize the income based repayment plan, which would have been the best option so that I would not have had to use finite loan deferment time while also accruing more interest on the loans. 

Once I graduated with my XXXX degree, I realized that I couldnt afford to repay my student loans even though I was working two part time jobs. Around XXXX I was finally advised by your representatives to enter an income based repayment plan. In XXXX, I moved to XXXX XXXX, CA and it took me roughly 4 years to gain employment where I could finally afford certain necessities such as health insurance and a 401k account. Less than a year into that position, I am now required to pay student loans that I simply can not afford. The cost of living in XXXX XXXX is almost 50 % higher than the national average and in order to live in accordance with societal expectations, one must budget accordingly. The monthly payment estimator on your website states that in the current program that Im enrolled in, I will owe $ XXXX/month. That is upwards of 20 % of my take home income. The estimator does not take into consideration the cost of living expenses for residing in a more costly city like XXXX XXXX, which makes it more difficult to save towards any future goals, such as buying a home or saving for retirement.",,"Navient Solutions, LLC.",CA,92116,,Consent provided,Web,2019-02-18,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,3154814

Despite multiple disputes, Experian has failed to address the discrepancies I have raised and continues to report incorrect information.

Issue Details : 1.Account Information : Original Creditor/Lender : XXXX Account Number : XXXX Date of Dispute : XX/XX/year>, XX/XX/year>, and XX/XX/year> XXXX of the Discrepancy : Experian is reporting an inaccurate balance on this account. The reported balance of {$7000.00} does not match the correct balance of {$7100.00}. 
I have provided supporting documentation in my previous disputes to demonstrate the correct balance, yet Experian claims the account has been verified without addressing the discrepancy. 
3.Repeated Disputes Without Resolution : I have disputed this information twice through Experians dispute process. Each time, the response has been that the information is verified and accurate, but no explanation or evidence has been provided to substantiate this. 
The reporting remains inaccurate, which negatively impacts my creditworthiness and financial opportunities. 

Request for Resolution : I request the following actions : 1. That Experian conducts a thorough investigation into this account and provides evidence from the original creditor verifying the balance they claim is correct. 
2. That the inaccurate information is deleted entirely from my credit report promptly, as required by the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) if it can not be verified.

3. That I am provided with detailed documentation of how Experian reached its conclusion regarding the dispute.

Supporting Documentation * Copies of my previous dispute submissions to Experian. 
* Any statements, receipts, or correspondence demonstrating the correct balance of the account. 

Impact of the Inaccuracy : This inaccurate reporting has caused significant stress and financial hardship. It has resulted in denial or unreasonable terms for a car loan, limiting my ability to secure reliable transportation. 
I trust that the CFPB will investigate this matter and ensure Experian upholds its obligation under the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) to maintain accurate and verifiable information. If Experian can not verify the accuracy of this account, I request its deletion from my credit report.

Handling of Unverifiable Information : According to Section 611, any inquiry that can not be verified must be removed.

Right of Verification : Section 609 grants me the right to verify each inquiry with an original signed contract.

Information Provider Responsibility : Section 623 requires that reported data is accurate and authorized.

Protection Against Identity Theft : Section 605A mandates the removal of unauthorized inquiries potentially related to identity theft.

The following issues exist with the reporting of this account : 1. Charge-Off Status : The account has been reported as charged off ; however, I have not received any formal notification, including a Form 1099-C, verifying that the debt has been charged off in compliance with IRS regulations. 
2. Purchased by Another Lender : The account is marked as purchased by another lender on certain reports. I never authorized or consented to the sale of my alleged debt to a third party.

3. Inconsistent Reporting : The details reported by the credit bureaus are inconsistent, including the dates of last activity, the reporting date, and comments about the account status. These inconsistencies violate the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), which mandates accurate and verifiable information. 

I have attempted to resolve these inaccuracies directly with the credit bureaus, but no action has been taken to verify or correct this information. I believe these actions harm my creditworthiness and may constitute unfair and deceptive practices. 

I request the CFPB to investigate this matter and ensure compliance with applicable consumer protection laws. I also request that any unverifiable or inaccurate information be promptly removed from my credit report. 

Enclosed are copies of my credit reports with the disputed account highlighted, along with any additional supporting documentation.

2025-01-06,Credit reporting or other personal consumer reports,Credit reporting,Improper use of your report,Reporting company used your report improperly,"JPMorgan Chase Bank is in violation of multiple laws set forth by Congress in regards to the following account # XXXX. 15 U.S. Code 1681a ( 2 ) ( a ) ( i ) states that the consumer report does not include information solely as to transactions or experiences ( payment history, charge off status ), between the consumer ( myself ) and the person ( JPMorgan Chase Bank ) making the report. Additionally, 15 U.S. Code 1681 s-2 ( a ) ( 1 ) ( A ) states that A person ( JPMorgan Chase Bank ) shall not furnish any information relating to a consumer ( ME ) to any consumer reporting agency ( XXXX, XXXX, XXXX ) XXXX the person knows or has reasonable cause to believe that the information is inaccurate. JPMorgan Chase Bank can not collect on a discharged debt. This is now considered a certificate of indebtedness per the IRS and income can not be reported. The IRS Clearly defines a charge off as Gross or Ordinary income, INCOME DOES NOT GET REPORTED ON THE CONSUMER REPORT which in fact makes reporting of this account inaccurate! I provided a screenshot from the IRS website. By Definition, the IRS Clearly says a Cancelled debt or Charge off is Income. The reporting of this account as a debt is inaccurate. I never received a 1099-C from JPMorgan Chase Bank for the cancelled debt of { { {$4100.00} } } in order to file as ordinary income. Where is my 1099-C JPMorgan Chase Bank is clearly writing off debt with the IRS without sending out 1099-C as required by the IRS for debts greater than { { {$600.00} } }. This is unsatisfactory! JPMorgan Chase Bank has been HEREBY PUT ON NOTICE that they are furnishing incorrect inaccurate information. In JPMorgan Chase Bank terms and conditions they agreed not to share my information with non affiliates. XXXX, XXXX, and XXXX is not an affiliate of JPMorgan Chase Bank nor are they "" bureaus ''. The only true credit bureau is the CFPB and they DO NOT furnish consumer reports as stated in federal law. I have a right to privacy and Per the Privacy Act of 1974 as a federally protected consumer I am now revoking any and all authorization I the consumer may have given you written, non written, verbal, and nonverbal per 5 U.S. Code 552a. Per the FCRA as a federally protected consumer I am now opting out of any and all authorization I the consumer may have given you written, non written, verbal, and non verbal per 15 USC 6802. I shall also point out their responsibility pursuant 15 U.S. Code section 1681s-2 ( a ) ( 1 ) ( B ) ( ii ) : ( a ) DUTY OF FURNISHERS OF INFORMATION TO PROVIDE ACCURATE INFORMATION 1 ) PROHIBITION ( B ) Reporting information after notice and confirmation of errors A person shall not furnish information relating to a consumer to any consumer reporting agency if ( i ) the person has been notified by the consumer, at the address specified by the person for such notices, that specific information is inaccurate ; and ( ii ) the information is, in fact, inaccurate. JPMorgan Chase Bank must also refund the remaining balance of the consumer account upon its termination. This is your 7 day notice to return ALL money due from this consumer account. XXXX Treatment of credit balances ; account termination. ( a ) Credit balances. When a credit balance in excess of { { {$1.00} } } is created on a credit account ( through transmittal of funds to a creditor in excess of the total balance due on an account, through rebates of unearned finance charges or insurance premiums, or through amounts otherwise owed to or held for the benefit of the consumer ), the creditor shall : ( 1 ) Credit the amount of the credit balance to the consumer 's account ; ( 2 ) Refund any part of the remaining credit balance within seven business days from receipt of a written request from the consumer ; ( 3 ) Make a good faith effort to refund to the consumer by cash, check, or money order, or credit to a deposit account of the consumer, any part of the credit balance remaining in the account for more than six months. No further action is required if the consumer 's current location is not known to the creditor and can not be traced through the consumer 's last known address or telephone number. ( b ) Account termination. ( 1 ) A creditor shall not terminate an account prior to its expiration date solely because the consumer does not incur a finance charge. ( 2 ) Nothing in paragraph ( b ) ( 1 ) of this section prohibits a creditor from terminating an account that is inactive for three or more consecutive months. An account is inactive for purposes of this paragraph if no credit has been extended ( such as by purchase, cash advance or balance transfer ) and if the account has no outstanding balance. ( c ) Timely settlement of estate debts ( 1 ) General rule. ( i ) Reasonable policies and procedures required. For credit card accounts under an open-end ( not home-secured ) consumer credit plan, card issuers must adopt reasonable written policies and procedures designed to ensure that an administrator of an estate of a deceased accountholder can determine the amount of and pay any balance on the account in a timely manner. ( ii ) Application to joint accounts. Paragraph ( c ) of this section does not apply to the account of a deceased consumer if a joint accountholder remains on the account. ( 2 ) Timely statement of balance ( i ) Requirement. Upon request by the administrator of an estate, a card issuer must provide the administrator with the amount of the balance on a deceased consumer 's account in a timely manner. ( ii ) Safe harbor. For purposes of paragraph ( c ) ( 2 ) ( i ) of this section, providing the amount of the balance on the account within 30 days of receiving the request is deemed to be timely. ( 3 ) Limitations after receipt of request from administrator ( i ) Limitation on fees and increases in annual percentage rates. After receiving a request from the administrator of an estate for the amount of the balance on a deceased consumer 's account, a card issuer must not impose any fees on the account ( such as a late fee, annual fee, or over-the-limit fee ) or increase any annual percentage rate, except as provided by XXXX XXXX b ) ( XXXX ). ( ii ) Limitation on trailing or residual interest.

2025-01-14,Credit reporting or other personal consumer reports,Credit reporting,Incorrect information on your report,Account information incorrect,"To Whom It May Concern, I am writing to dispute the inaccurate and misleading reporting of the closed account referenced below on my credit report. I demand the immediate deletion of this account from my credit report due to numerous violations of the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), specifically 15 U.S.C. 1681 and its subchapters, which require accurate, complete, and up-to-date reporting of all credit information. 

The account in question is listed as a charged off auto loan, but the information is inaccurate, incomplete, and misleading. Below are the key discrepancies and violations : Account Information : Account Number ( redacted ) : XXXX Creditor Name : XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Account Type : Auto Loan Account Status : Closed High Balance : {$23000.00} ( XXXX and Experian ) ; {$15000.00} ( XXXX XXXX Last Verified : XX/XX/XXXX Date Opened : XX/XX/XXXX to XX/XX/XXXX Balance Owed : {$15000.00} Closed Date : XX/XX/XXXX Account Rating : Derogatory ( Across All Bureaus ) Payment Status : Collection/Chargeoff Creditor Remarks : Charged off as bad debt / Merchandise taken back by XXXX XXXX Payment XXXX XXXX {$0.00} Last Payment : XX/XX/XXXX ( XXXX and Experian ), XX/XX/XXXX ( XXXX ) Past XXXX Amount : {$4900.00} ( XXXX ) Discrepancies and Violations : Incorrect Date of Last Activity The "" Date of Last Activity '' is reported inconsistently across the credit bureaus : XXXX reports XX/XX/XXXX XXXX 
Experian reports XX/XX/XXXX. 
XXXX reports XX/XX/XXXX. 
This inconsistency violates 15 U.S.C. 1681e ( b ), which mandates that credit information must be accurate, complete, and up-to-date. 
Failure to Correct Inaccurate Reporting of XXXX The account is listed as "" charged off as bad debt '' across all three credit bureaus, which is misleading and incorrect. The account was disputed previously but was reported with contradictory remarks : Experian and XXXX report that the dispute was resolved and indicate that the account was resolved by the data furnisher, but the charge-off status still remains. 
XXXX reports that merchandise was taken back by the credit grantor, which does not accurately reflect the accounts status and is an incomplete and misleading statement. 
Under 15 U.S.C. 1681i ( a ) ( 1 ) ( A ), if an account is disputed and later resolved, the credit reporting agencies are required to ensure that the information reported is accurate. This account has not been properly corrected, thus violating the FCRA. 
Inaccurate Payment History The payment history is inconsistent : XXXX and Experian report the last payment as XX/XX/XXXX, whereas XXXX reports the last payment as XX/XX/XXXX. 
This discrepancy in payment history is a direct violation of 15 U.S.C. 1681i, which requires a credit reporting agency to correct any inaccuracies and ensure the account history is properly reported. 
Inaccurate XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX is reporting a past due amount of {$4900.00}, which is incorrect. The past due balance should reflect the current status of the account, including any payments or adjustments made, but the figure is outdated and incorrect. This violates the requirement under 15 U.S.C. 1681c to report accurate and complete information. 

Failure to Properly Report Account Status The account was closed and charged off, but the FCRA Section 1681e ( b ) requires that information on closed accounts be fully accurate. The inaccurate remarks and inconsistent reporting of the status of the account suggest that the account is still open or unresolved, which is not the case. This misreporting is misleading and violates my rights under 15 U.S.C. 1681c.

Legal Right to Seek Damages : Under 15 U.S.C. 1681n, I am entitled to seek statutory damages of up to {$1000.00} per violation if the credit reporting agencies willfully fail to comply with the FCRA. The multiple violations outlined above constitute willful noncompliance, and I am prepared to pursue legal action to recover statutory damages for each violation if this matter is not resolved to my satisfaction. 

XXXX Requested : Given the severe and multiple violations outlined above, I demand the following actions : Immediate Deletion of the Account This account must be permanently removed from all of my credit reports due to its inaccurate and misleading information. 
Correction of XXXX XXXX and Account XXXX If this account is not deleted, I demand that all information regarding late payments and the account status be corrected to reflect the true nature of the account, including any payments made. 
Full XXXX and XXXX of Account XXXX I demand an immediate and thorough investigation into this account, ensuring that accurate and complete information is reported to all three credit bureaus. 
Confirmation of XXXX I expect a written confirmation that the creditor has been notified of this dispute and that all inaccurate information has been corrected or removed from my credit file. 
Failure to comply with my request will result in my filing a formal complaint with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ), and I will pursue legal action for damages of up to {$1000.00} per violation under 15 U.S.C. 1681n.

Despite my multiple submissions of the required documentation as a victim of human trafficking, Experian continues to deny my request to block adverse information from my credit file.

Specifically, I have provided : A self-attestation letter signed by both myself and an authorized officer from an authorized agency.

A victim determination letter, also signed by myself and the authorized agency.

These documents have been submitted to Experian on three or four separate occasions. While both XXXX and XXXX accepted the same documentation and blocked the adverse information as required under Section 605C, Experian has refused to do so. This has caused significant inconsistencies across my credit reports and continues to harm my financial standing. 

Experian has repeatedly sent me identical, automated responses, despite my compliance with all legal requirements for exercising my rights under the FCRA. It appears there has been no meaningful human review of my case, yet the only denial reason they give is for me to submit a victim determination letter even though I have sent it to them on numerous occasions I respectfully request that the CFPB : 1. Investigate the methods and tools Experian is using to determine its denial of my request to block adverse information.

2. Require Experian to conduct a human review of my case, as their automated responses fail to address the merits of my documentation and circumstances.

3. Ensure Experian complies with its obligations under Section 605C of the FCRA, as both XXXX and XXXX have already done. 

As a victim of trafficking, I should not be subjected to this repeated and unjust denial of my rights, especially after providing all required documentation multiple times. I urge the CFPB to intervene and hold Experian accountable for its obligations under the law. 

Thank you for your prompt attention to this matter.

SYNCB/PPC has the obligation to correct action. On XX/XX/XXXX, the CFPB released Circular XXXX to reiterate creditors adverse action notice requirements under ECOA.

Under 15 USC 1666B Grace period- If an open end consumer credit plan provides a time period within which an obligor may repay any portion of the credit extended without incurring an additional finance charge, such additional finance charge may not be imposed with respect to such portion of the credit extended for the billing cycle of which such period is a part, unless a statement which includes the amount upon which the finance charge for the period is based was mailed or delivered to the consumer not later than 21 days before the date specified in the statement by which payment must be made in order to avoid imposition of that finance charge. Which SYNCB/PPC NEVER PERFORMED this 21 days in advance so why are they furnishing negative damaging information "" late payments '' on my consumer report?

As you are aware, your agency does not own the debt but is acting as a third-party collector on behalf of the original creditor. I have kindly emailed the original creditor to verify whether the debt has been sold or if you have been authorized to report it to the credit bureaus. This verification will help me assess if your actions are in compliance with the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act ( FDCPA ) and the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ). 

Please be advised that I am carefully monitoring the situation for any potential misleading practices under the FDCPA, including, but not limited to, the misrepresentation of debt ownership or authority to report on my credit profile. 

I respectfully request that you provide me with the following information : Written confirmation that your agency is legally authorized to report the debt to the credit bureaus, either through ownership or explicit authorization from the original creditor. 
Documentation proving that your agency has the authority to report this debt on behalf of the original creditor, if applicable. 
Should it be found that this debt was not properly transferred, or that your agency lacks the necessary authorization to report on my credit file, I will consider further actions, including filing a formal dispute with the credit bureaus and reporting the issue to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ) for investigation. 

I expect a prompt response within 30 days, as required by law. If the proper documentation can not be provided, I request that you immediately remove this debt from my credit report and cease any further reporting related to it. 

Thank you for your attention to this matter.

During this call, the representative suggested that I apply for a hardship modification to which I agreed. The representative suggested that the hardship modification may give me the short term reprieve to allow time to catch up with payments. 

Following this conversation, at XXXX AM on XX/XX/year>, I received an email from XXXX confirming my request for a hardship modification and requesting that I upload evidence of my hardship to include a hardship letter and XXXX months of bank statements. The info was to be uploaded to Mosaic via a secure web link which was provided in their email. 
I acquired the bank statements and hardship letter and compiled and uploaded the requested documents in XX/XX/year>. 
On or about XX/XX/year>, I contacted Solar Mosaic and spoke to a representative who confirmed receipt of my documents and furthermore stated that my request was under review. 

From XXXX through XX/XX/year>, I received multiple calls from representatives of both Solar Mosaic and XXXX XXXX. During these calls, I explained that I had submitted a hardship modification request to Solar Mosaic. 

The representatives from Solar Mosaic informed me that my application was received but still being reviewed, while the XXXX XXXX stated that they were the debt collectors for Solar Mosaic and would proceed to reach out to Solar Mosaic to confirm my hardship request. Both parties assured me that our conversations were being recorded and that they were also updating my account notes to reflect the pending hardship modification request and our contact. 

From XXXX through XX/XX/year>, I also subsequently received written communication from Solar Mosaic & XXXX XXXX regarding the past due amount of my loan, including threats of default and referral to a debt collector. While I proceeded to make some payments to Solar Mosaic during that period, I never received any written update or decision regarding the status of my hardship modification request which was submitted in XX/XX/year>. 

In XX/XX/year>, I received a notice from a credit monitoring service that my solar mosaic loan had been closed and possibly transferred to a debt collection agency, XXXX XXXX XXXX.I contacted Solar Mosaic who confirmed that the company had transferred my account to XXXX XXXX XXXX and they had no further response or update concerning my hardship modification request and referred me to XXXX  XXXX. 

Violations and Concerns : - Failure to Communicate : Solar Mosaic failed to provide a written response or update regarding the outcome of my hardship modification request. 
- Deceptive Business Practices : Promising to review my hardship request while subsequently transferring my account to a debt collector without notice constitutes misleading and deceptive business practices. 
- Lack of Transparency : Solar Mosaic did not provide any documentation or explanation for the transfer of my loan to XXXX XXXX XXXX. 
Emotional and Financial Impact : This mishandling has caused financial strain, emotional distress, and negatively impacted my credit score.

Requested Action : Conduct an investigation into Solar Mosaic 's handling of hardship modification requests and their failure to communicate decisions to customers.

Determine whether Solar Mosaic violated any Federal Trade Commission ( FTC ) regulations related to deceptive business practices.

Require Solar Mosaic to restore my account to good standing and process my hardship modification request as originally submitted. 

Ensure the removal of any negative credit reporting caused by this transfer to a debt collector. 

Promptly address this matter due to the urgency of the situation, as the debt collector is currently seeking full repayment.

2025-02-03,Credit reporting or other personal consumer reports,Credit reporting,Incorrect information on your report,Information belongs to someone else,"consumer Reporting Agencies play a crucial role in gathering and assessing consumer credit information. However, they must exercise their responsibilities with fairness, impartiality, and respect for the consumers right to privacy. The banking system relies on accurate and fair credit reporting, and when these reporting methods are unfair, it undermines public trust, which is vital for the system 's stability. I never gave my explicit, written consent for these agencies to report my information, which is a violation of 15 U.S. Code 1681b ( 2 ). This violation has led to an alleged case of identity theft, breaching 15 U.S. Code 1681c-2. The accounts in question are not related to any transactions made by me.

The Fair Debt Collection Practices Act was created to ensure that laws and procedures are in place to protect consumers from abusive, deceptive, and unfair practices by debt collectors. In this case, the company has violated 15 U.S. Code 1692f, which prohibits debt collectors from using unfair or unconscionable means to collect a debt. Specifically, they can not collect any amounts that arent explicitly authorized by the agreement or allowed by law. Additionally, the company has violated 15 U.S. Code 1692e, which prohibits the use of false, deceptive, or misleading representations in debt collection efforts. This includes using deceptive methods to collect a debt or gather consumer information. Moreover, they are forbidden from contacting consumers at inconvenient times or places, or engaging in behavior that harasses or abuses consumers. 

In this case, the company has harassed me by claiming I owe a debt that I do not recognize as my responsibility. They have also contacted me at inconvenient times and places, in violation of the law.

I recently learned that the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ) has filed a lawsuit against Experian. The allegations against Experian include : Accepting unreliable and inaccurate information from data furnishers, and Failing to notify consumers of the results of their disputes in violation of federal laws. 



These allegations align directly with my situation. Experian has not made any effort to address my dispute, remove the inaccurate information, or correct the errors despite their obligations under the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ). 



The presence of these inaccurate and derogatory accounts on my credit report is negatively affecting my financial stability and opportunities, including my ability to secure housing and a vehicle.

If this issue is not addressed, I will have no choice but to pursue additional legal remedies to protect my rights.

2018-03-15,Vehicle loan or lease,Loan,Struggling to pay your loan,Loan balance remaining after the vehicle is repossessed and sold,"Letter I wrote To Wells Fargo Hello, I am writing this letter today to express my frustration and disappointment with Wells Fargo customer service and how I have been unjustly penalized through a bank error. 
A friend of mine, XXXX XXXX, gave me a gift of XXXX XXXX dollars. XXXX sent XXXX XXXX dollars through a wire and another XXXX XXXX dollars through XXXX XXXX XXXX. XXXX then wanted to revert XXXX XXXX dollars back to her account. XXXX didnt communicate this with me. I would have given XXXX the XXXX XXXX dollars that she wanted back if she did. So, my account was frozen by the fraud department without an email being sent or the courtesy of an explanation prior to the account being frozen. I only saw a number posted on my online Wells Fargo account. The phone representative explained that the account was under investigation for fraud. He explained to me that the funds were unauthorized. XXXX never claimed the transaction was unauthorized. After explaining to the representative that I had nothing to do with this, I was told that the account would be unfrozen and to follow up on Tuesday, the next week. I decided to wait it out and my account was closed on the following Monday. After following up on Tuesday, speaking to around 10 reps in many departments, including supervisors, I was told that the account was closed and that it couldn't be reopened. 
My credit card was then closed because my checking account was closed. The only checking account I had was a Wells Fargo College account. I was satisfied with what I had and never thought to open another checking with a different bank to deposit my money. After my checking account was closed unjustly, all the payments that were due to be sent ended up being charge backs into all my credit cards and my University account. The charge back fees amounted to around XXXX $ and I ended up with late payments. Up until then, I had 260 payments always on time and no derogatory marks in my credit history. I couldnt even get my money back. I had put a lot of effort and work into building my credit. It was XXXX and now its at XXXX. Its unjust that I had to be a victim of a bank error and not be able to find a rep that could help solve the issue. 
I went to two banks in person to be misinformed about reopening my college checking account with the same stipulations I had before. I was told that they could reopen the same closed checking and credit card accounts. All in all, I was left with a bad memory of the poor Wells Fargo customer service, loss of the time and loss of money ( many hours it took to earn the money ). There were no reparations for that and most importantly no accountability of the bank error. XXXX also contacted XXXX and had a letter sent stating that the two transactions were authorized. 

Thank you. 



I didnt have access to funds or could use checking or credit card to pay my auto loan bill. After months Wells Fargo decided to reopen my college checking account which had been grandfathered and my credit card because of a bank error. Though I was left with my first delinquency on my credit report. 

I couldnt pay my auto loan bill which I was high pressured to get car with misleading tactics along with a XXXX $ warranty. 

I spoke with many reps and Vice Presidents office of Wells Fargo Dealer Services to share my story. They were non compliant to fix my only derogatory credit mark. Wells Fargo Dealer services then disable my online account, so I couldnt make payments on car. They told me I had to pay XXXX or the car would be repossessed. The car was for sale for XXXX and I had already made payments of XXXX $ on the car. I didnt have full balance to pay the car so my car was reprocessed at XXXX and I couldnt do anything about it. 

Now I have a serious delinquency on my credit report and I also cant do anything about it. I was told by a rep that I would still be responsible for payments after the car is sold. What kind of injustice is that? 

I dont have a derogatory mark on 300+ payments for all my credit cards and my credit to debt ratio is around half. 

I was curious to what this delinquency had triggered. As XX/XX/2018, I made my first credit card inquiry for 2 student credit cards and was not approved.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,WELLS FARGO & COMPANY,GA,30084,,Consent provided,Web,2018-03-16,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,2844571

He ended up being a scammer who put me through an online interview and chatted with me for a couple weeks. He said that I would meet with my supervisor and undergo training but first I needed to have office equipment shipped ( hardware, software, printer, fax machine, etc.. ). He sent me 2 checks ( 1. {$4900.00} and 2. {$4900.00} ). The first time on XX/XX/XXXX, he asked me to deposit the check into my bank account at Wells Fargo and then withdraw {$4900.00} in cash to deposit to a "" vendor '' account at XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX. I attempted to deposit the check at the ATM machine but the alert on the screen said that the value of the check was too high to deposit into the ATM machine and I had to go inside the branch to deposit it and so I did. I deposited the check with XXXX XXXX. I attempted to deposit at XXXX and was denied because the "" vendor '' account was blocked. I then went back to Wells Fargo and deposited the cash in-branch, into a "" vendor '' account ( Acct holder 's name : XXXX XXXX, Acct # : XXXX ). I even showed the teller the account information from the XXXXXXXX on my phone. 

The second check was received on XX/XX/XXXXand I went through the same process, only this time the scammer asked me to do the deposit of the check, withdrawal of cash, and then subsequent deposit into a vendor account ( Acct holder 's name : XXXX XXXX, Acct # : XXXX ) all at Wells Fargo. I did this process again with XXXX in-branch at Well Fargo this time, and XXXX XXXX remembered me from the previous correspondence. 

When I received another check from the scammer I knew something was suspicious. I called Wells Fargo XXXX XXXX to let them know that I was suspicious of recent activity on my account and that's when I was informed that both of the checks I deposited bounced. I then immediately filed a police report, a fraud claim with Wells Fargo, reported this to the FTC and the FBI. 

Wells Fargo denied my claim stating that I authorized the deposits. I asked them why the branch tellers did not warn me that the activity was suspicious and they then responded that I did not deposit the checks in branch. They responded that all teams at Wells Fargo corroborate that I deposited the checks at the ATM machine. I told them that the first time I did attempt to deposit the check at the ATM machine but the alert said that the value was too high to deposit at the ATM machine so I went in-branch. They restated that I deposited the checks at the ATM machine. I asked them to check the security camera footage and the manager said he would request them and then get back to me the next day. He did not get back to me and when I went back to the branch XXXX XXXX ( the personal banker of the case ) said that XXXX ( the branch manager ) was gone for 7 days. The next time I spoke to XXXX XXXX he stated that the resolution team has the footage and it is internal information only. I asked to talk to the resolution team and he said that it is not a client-facing team.

2025-01-02,Credit reporting or other personal consumer reports,Credit reporting,Improper use of your report,Reporting company used your report improperly,""" The Fair Credit Reporting Act ( 15 U.S. Code 1681 ) says ( 1 ) The banking system is dependent upon fair and accurate credit reporting. Inaccurate credit reports directly impair the efficiency of the banking system, and unfair credit reporting methods undermine the public confidence, which is essential to the continued functioning of the banking system.

So whenever there is a violation under the FCRA, it impairs the efficiency of the banking system. This is a violation of my privacy with my consumer report, since I control what is listed and what is not. In the event that any accounts are reported without my written consent, that is considered identity theft.

This is a violation of both 15 U.S. Code 1681b ( 2 ) and 15 U.S. Code 1681c-2. This leads way to civil liability against the credit reporting agency for negligent and willful noncompliance under 15 U.S. Code 1681n, which allows for {$1000.00} per violation, for each account listed without my expressed written consent.

I looked at my consumer reports and noticed accounts I never gave anyone permission to report. Consumer reporting agencies have assumed a vital role and have a responsibility to report consumer information to the best of their ability with maximum possible accuracy like the Fair Credit Reporting Act clearly states. I did not provide written consent to report them.

Furthermore, no communication has been received from your office through the CFPB regarding the actions taken or the reasons for any delay or noncompliance.

Additionally, I must emphasize that your agency is obligated to block not only the disputed information or items requested but also any wrong information or items you are reporting on my consumer credit report. Failure to ensure the accuracy of the report violates your statutory responsibilities under FCRA 611 ( 15 U.S.C. 1681i ) and demonstrates a troubling pattern of negligence.

As a result of your continued disregard for these obligations, I have retained a law firm specializing in Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) violations to address this matter. My law firm is actively reviewing your agency 's actions and will pursue all available remedies, including : Filing a lawsuit to seek damages for willful noncompliance under 15 U.S.C. 1681n, including statutory damages, punitive damages, and compensation for financial and emotional harm.

Reporting your agencys noncompliance to other government authorities, such as the Federal Trade Commission ( FTC ) and the State Attorney Generals Office, to ensure accountability and further oversight.

Please be advised that this is not merely a matter of dispute resolution but a legal issue that will now be handled by my law firm. Stemming from the statutes governed by the Rules of Laws, I trust that you will reconsider your obligations under the FCRA and take immediate corrective action to avoid further escalation.

Should your agency wish to communicate regarding this matter, please direct all correspondence to my law firm. Failure to comply with your legal responsibilities will result in further action through appropriate regulatory authorities and the courts.

Inaccurate credit reports directly impair the efficiency of the banking system, and unfair credit reporting methods undermine the public confidence which is essential to the continued functioning of the banking system.

So whenever there is a violation under the FCRA, it impairs the efficiency of the banking system. This is a violation of TILA US Code 1666B since I was never late.

I recently reviewed my consumer report and noticed an incorrect late payment record on my XXXXXXXX XXXX  account [ XXXX ]. I have always maintained timely payments on this account. Under the Fair Credit Billing Act ( FCBA ) and the Truth in Lending Act ( TILA ), creditors are required to accurately report consumer transactions and provide a mechanism for correcting errors in a timely manner. Please conduct an investigation into this matter, and if you can not provide documentary evidence of these supposed late payments, I demand these payments to be updated to on time as they should be as I was NEVER late. I expect these updates to be made promptly, in compliance with the law.

I sent letters to XXXX, XXXX, and Experian detailing the information I believed was incorrect and requested that they correct the errors and provide me with an update once the changes were made. In compliance with the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), which mandates a 30-day response period under 15 U.S.C. 1681i ( a ) ( 1 ) ( A ), I allowed 30 days, plus an additional 15 days for mailing, for their investigation and response. 

However, I did not see any updates on my credit report. Later, I received a letter from XXXX requesting that I confirm my identity by sending personal documents, which I promptly provided. From the other bureaus, I received no response at all, a clear violation of their obligation to investigate disputes and respond under the FCRA. 

I sent a follow-up letter to all three bureaus, informing them that since they had not responded, they were required under 15 U.S.C. 1681i ( a ) ( 5 ) to delete the inaccurate information. Additionally, I requested that if they had verified the disputed items, they provide me with the documentation they used to validate the information. Once again, I received no response, which constitutes another breach of the FCRA 's requirements.

This process has been extremely stressful, as the inaccurate reporting has negatively impacted my ability to build business credit. The failure of the credit bureaus to act on my dispute within the legally mandated time frame has now exceeded 60 days since my initial request. In my final letter, sent in XXXX, I stated that I would escalate the matter to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ) if I did not receive a response. Despite this warning, I have still received no communication or resolution. 

The credit bureaus ' noncompliance with 15 U.S.C. 1681i has left me no choice but to take matters into my own hands.

2025-03-06,Credit card,General-purpose credit card or charge card,Problem with a purchase shown on your statement,Credit card company isn't resolving a dispute about a purchase on your statement,"Complainant : XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, FL XXXX Financial Institution : Citi Cards XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, KY XXXX Subject : Formal Billing Dispute Interest Calculation Transparency & Account Protection Account Number : XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Disputed Amount : {$7300.00} Complaint Details : I am filing this complaint against Citi Cards regarding a billing dispute for the total amount of {$7300.00} on my credit card account ( XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX ). On XX/XX/XXXX, I submitted a formal dispute to Citi Cards at XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX, KY XXXX in accordance with my billing rights under the Fair Credit Billing Act ( FCBA ) and the Truth in Lending Act ( TILA ).

The dispute was submitted because the interest calculations on my account appear inconsistent with the disclosed Annual Percentage Rate ( APR ), Daily Periodic Rate ( DPR ), and Average Daily Balance ( ADB ). The figures provided on my statement do not align with my own calculations, and I have not been provided a clear breakdown of how the interest rate was applied to my account. 

Nature of the Dispute : 1. Incorrect or Unclear Interest Rate Calculations The APR provided does not align with my calculated DPR and ADB, raising questions about how the final interest charge was determined.

2. Lack of Transparency While APR is disclosed, Citi has not provided the raw interest rate used to calculate my charges, making it impossible to verify whether I am being overcharged. 
3. Failure to Provide Required Documentation Under TILA and FCBA, I am entitled to a detailed, written breakdown of how my balance was calculated, including how interest, fees, and payments are allocated. 
4. Potential IRS Compliance Issue Under IRS regulations, any interest amount exceeding {$10.00} requires a 1099-INT form for tax reporting purposes. To date, I have not received one. If Citi Cards has failed to issue the required documentation, this raises serious tax compliance concerns. 

The Core Issue with Interest Calculations The interest rate is the raw percentage charged on the amount I owe before any extra fees or calculations. The APR includes fees and represents the yearly cost of borrowing, while the Daily Periodic Rate ( DPR ) is just a small piece of the APR. But none of these numbers actually tell me the pure interest rate being used to calculate my charges, and thats a major issue. 

APR is a long-term cost representation, DPR is just a step in the math, and the actual interest rate is the hidden percentage that controls how much Im truly being charged. Without knowing the true interest rate, there is no way to verify whether the lenders interest calculations are correct. 

Requested Information : To resolve this matter, I request that Citi Cards provide a full written response detailing the following : 1. A clear separation of the actual interest rate applied versus any fees included in the APR.

2. The precise Daily Periodic Rate ( DPR ) used and how it was derived.

3. A full breakdown of how my Average Daily Balance ( ADB ) was calculated.

4. A detailed explanation of how my APR and daily interest are calculated, including how my payments are allocated between principal and interest.

5. A full review of my account to verify that all calculations have been applied correctly.

6. A revised statement, if necessary, that accurately reflects the interest and payment structure.

7. Clarification regarding any discrepancies that may have led to miscalculations or inconsistencies.

8. Written confirmation that no payments are required until this dispute is fully reviewed and resolved.

9. Issuance of a 1099-INT form for any interest assessed to my account, as required by law.

Legal Protections & Account Safeguards : The Fair Credit Billing Act ( FCBA ) and the Truth in Lending Act ( TILA ) both provide protections that ensure consumers can dispute any questionable charge, including interest assessments and balance discrepancies, without the risk of retaliation or unfair treatment by the lender. These laws safeguard my right to request full transparency in how my balance is calculated and ensure that no payments are required until the dispute is properly reviewed and resolved.

As required by law under 15 U.S. Code 1666 ( c ) : My account must not be subjected to adverse action ( such as late fees, penalties, or negative credit reporting ) while this dispute is under review.

The disputed amount can not be collected until Citi provides written evidence supporting the accuracy of the charges.

Additionally, nowhere in federal law does it state that a certain transaction can only be disputed under the Billing Rights Act. My right to dispute interest calculations, balance discrepancies, and account accuracy is protected under multiple consumer protection laws, including TILA and FCBA.

In accordance with federal consumer protection laws, my account should be placed on hold until this matter is fully reviewed and resolved. It is my right to receive a clear and accurate breakdown of how interest and balances are calculated before being required to make further payments. Continuing to impose payment obligations without providing this critical information could be considered unfair and improper under applicable laws.

I also request written confirmation that Citi will not close my account or take adverse action due to this dispute. The law does not limit disputes to specific transactionsconsumers are allowed to dispute total balances, interest calculations, and account inaccuracies without facing retaliation.

Supporting Documentation : Copy of my original dispute letter sent to Requested CFPB Action : I request that the CFPB intervene to ensure that Citi Cards : Provides a full and transparent explanation of how my interest was calculated.

Does not take adverse action against my account while the dispute is under review.

Issues a formal response within 30 days as required by law.

Suspends collection efforts on the disputed amount until the matter is resolved.

Corrects any errors found in the interest calculation and adjusts the balance accordingly.

Issues a 1099-INT form for any interest assessed, as required by IRS regulations .

Since my dispute was filed in compliance with federal law, I am requesting CFPB oversight to ensure that Citi follows all legal requirements and provides the transparency I am entitled to under TILA and FCBA.

Inaccurate credit reports directly impair the efficiency of the banking system, and unfair credit reporting methods undermine the public confidence, which is essential to the continued functioning of the banking system.

So whenever there is a violation under the FCRA, it impairs the efficiency of the banking system. This is a violation of my privacy with my consumer report, since I control what is listed and what is not. In the event that any accounts are reported without my written consent, that is considered identity theft.

This is a violation of both 15 U.S. Code 1681b ( 2 ) and 15 U.S. Code 1681c-2. This leads way to civil liability against the credit reporting agency for negligent and willful noncompliance under 15 U.S. Code 1681n, which allows for {$1000.00} per violation, for each account listed without my expressed written consent.

I looked at my consumer reports and noticed accounts I never gave anyone permission to report. Consumer reporting agencies have assumed a vital role and have a responsibility to report consumer information to the best of their ability with maximum possible accuracy like the Fair Credit Reporting Act clearly states.

I submitted my complaint in writing to American Education Services a few days later after speaking with the AES representative, expressing my displeasure with their actions of refinancing my loan payment without my consent. 

I asked for AES to immediately investigate this matter and take the following corrective actions : Reverse the loan refinance : I request that you rescind the refinance and return my loans to their original status.

When I originally tried to pay my mortgage to Arvest, via their automated system I was told that my information did not exist in their system. Due to not receiving the information from Arvest that I needed in order to pay ( including a contact number ) I was not able to pay my mortgage in a timely manner to Arvest.

This negligent and unethical delay in proper notification of how to pay my mortgage in a timely manner, by Arvest, resulted in my interest owed being increased by {$90.00} per week.

During this time, I never had a late payment on any of my credit cards or home mortgage loan, not even XXXX time. I maintained excellent credit score, well above XXXX and lately at XXXX. 

Early this year I began receiving notices against each of my accounts from Chase Bank, other than the home mortgage, that Chase has decided to close all of my personal and XXXX Credit Card accounts. I was given a certain date to close my accounts out. Chase said it was within its rights to do so and they did n't have to give me a reason for their action. Including in those accounts were XXXX custodial accounts ; XXXX accounts belong to my daughters attending XXXX XXXX and XXXX of my XXXX-years old mother. I found it outrageous but decided to comply with their requests. 

I rushed to open new bank accounts with another institution and got new credit cards from XXXX and XXXX XXXX. I went to the local branch of Chase Bank and settled all of my credit cards and withdrew my personal funds. 

My Mileage Plus United Chase Visa card, XXXX of XXXX credit cards with Chase, had {$10000.00} balance due per the previous months statement that I paid it off on XXXX XXXX, 2015. On XXXX XXXX, 2015, I went to the local bank branch and paid the {$990.00}, the balance incurred since the last statement. Later, I learned that bank assessed additional {$87.00} interest on XXXX XXXX, 2015 that also was paid on XXXX XXXX, 2015, via a phone call. I was entitled to a refund on the annual fee of {$85.00} assessed earlier. 

I had used online access, portal provided by the Chase Bank, to manage my accounts. After the accounts were settled and closed Chase took away my on-line access. In XXXX 2015, I was denied a refinancing loan on my personal residence because Chase had reported {$370.00} due on my XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX account and reported XXXX late payments ranging between {$25.00} and {$42.00} over the next three month. That was the first time I learned I had derogatory reports on my credit report. 

I called the Bank on XXXX XXXX to confirm these charges. I did not realize that after I had paid up my last balance and brought my XXXX XXXX balance to XXXX on XXXX XXXX, Chase allowed XXXX unauthorized charges that I had no knowledge of on the XXXX Card on XXXX XXXX and XXXX for {$290.00}. Chase also refunded {$85.00} annual fee and had an outstanding balance of {$200.00}. ( XXXX & XXXX bank statements are attached. ) Over the next 6 months that balance became {$370.00} after Chase added late fee and interest and reported XXXX late payments to the Credit Bureaus. Chase never attempted to contact me via a phone call or sent a customary letter or provided monthly bank statements. 

Chase customer service representative, who identified herself as XXXX, told me that it was not Bank 's responsibility to inform me about my statements because I was using an on-line access. The fact that the on-line access was taken away after I was forced to close my accounts was none of their concern. However, the Bank felt obliged to continue to assess interest and penalties and also reported to the Credit Bureaus but saw no reason to inform me. I requested the bank statements. 

After the bank statements were received I called bank on XXXX XXXX, 2015, to resolve my credit report issues. XXXX XXXX from XXXX XXXX location told me that I had no recourse and all he could do was to accept my payment of {$370.00} ( includes {$170.00} in penalties and interest ) on the phone that could be charged to my new XXXX XXXX account. I authorized the payment. Chase maintained my personal information ( phone, address, new bank ) but chose not to contact me.

The accounts in question has been reported as a charge-offs, and yet they continue to be furnished on my credit report as an outstanding debt. Furthermore, I stand firm on my position that this reporting is both inaccurate and unlawful, and I demand its immediate removal from my credit report. 
According to the information available to me, the creditor has issued a Form XXXX for this account, signifying that the debt has been canceled and reported as ordinary income for tax purposes. If a charge-off is considered ordinary income, as evidenced by the issuance of a XXXX, it can not simultaneously be reported as a collectible debt. Reporting the account in this manner is not only misleading but also inconsistent with the legal implications of debt cancellation. 
Additionally, the creditor has failed to provide me with a copy of the XXXX form to file on my tax return as required by law. This failure to notify me is another indication of the creditors negligence and failure to comply with regulatory standards. 
Under 15 U.S.C. 1681b, the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) requires that information furnished to consumer reporting agencies must be accurate and permissible under the law. The continued reporting of a canceled debt as an outstanding obligation violates these provisions and is causing ongoing harm to my creditworthiness and financial well-being.

I request that the creditor and all associated parties immediately take the following actions : 1. Cease reporting this account as an outstanding debt on my credit report and remove all associated negative marks. 
2. Have XXXX provide ( XXXX XXXX ) and CFPB with a copy of the XXXX form for my records and tax reporting purposes.

FCRA Violations : Under 15 U.S. Code 1666b, creditors are required to send periodic statements at least 21 days before the payment due date.

When disputing this debt with the major credit reporting bureaus I have included the aforementioned information.

Despite this obvious non compliance with various governing laws and regulations all the major credit reporting bureau have continued to report this incorrect information on my credit report.

Furthermore, the credit bureau must notify the consumer of the reinsertion in writing, specifying the details of the certification. To date, I have not received any such notification or evidence.

Pursuant to the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), 15 USC 1681i ( 7 ), credit reporting agencies are obligated to provide a description of the investigation within 15 days of receiving a consumer 's dispute.

Based on my records and the terms of this account, the payments were made on time, and the reported 30-day late payments in XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX are incorrect. These discrepancies violate the FCRA 's requirement for credit reporting agencies to ensure maximum accuracy and fairness in consumer reporting ( 15 USC 1681e ( b ) ). 
Reference to PAANL ( Paid As Agreed, Never Late ) : The terms of my agreement with XXXX XXXX  have always been adhered to, and the account in question should reflect a status of "" Paid As Agreed, Never Late '' based on the timely payments made. This account has consistently been in good standing, and the reported late payments contradict the actual payment history. It is critical that my credit report accurately represents my financial responsibility and commitment to meeting payment obligations. 
I am requesting that my account status be corrected to "" Paid As Agreed, Never Late '' to accurately reflect my on-time payment history. Inaccurate reporting of late payments adversely affects my creditworthiness and violates the accuracy standards required under the FCRA. 
Supporting Evidence : XXXX. 
XXXX Two-Year Payment History : Late payment reported for XXXX Experian Two-Year Payment History : Late payment reported for XX/XX/XXXX. 

XXXX Two-Year Payment History : Late payment reported for XX/XX/XXXX. 
These inconsistencies across the three credit bureaus further indicate potential errors in the reporting process. 
Requested Action : 1. Investigation of Dispute : Conduct a thorough investigation to verify the accuracy of the reported late payments.

2. Documentation of Process : Provide a detailed description of the reasonable procedures you have adopted to investigate this dispute, as required by 15 USC 1681i ( 7 ).

3. Correction of Errors : If the late payment reporting can not be substantiated with verifiable proof, promptly update the account to reflect its accurate status as "" Paid As Agreed, Never Late. '' 4. Proof of Late Payments : Provide documented proof supporting the claim of late payments, including specific details such as dates, amounts, and any relevant communication indicating these payments were late. 
Legal References : Per 15 USC 1681 ( a ) ( 2 ) ( A ) ( i ), my consumer report should only contain accurate information regarding transactions between me and the creditor. 

Section 1666 ( b ) of Title 15 mandates that periodic statements must be sent to consumers at least 21 days before the payment due date, ensuring sufficient notice for timely payments. 
Next Steps : If your investigation confirms that the reported late payments are incorrect, I request the prompt correction of my credit report to accurately reflect my payment history. If you can not verify the accuracy of the late payments, I expect you to provide the required details and take corrective actions within the 30-day timeframe mandated by the FCRA.

Beginning XX/XX/XXXX I visited the bank branch at XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX to withdraw some of those funds, but was told the check had not cleared yet. On XX/XX/XXXX I was told the funds had cleared but were not available to be withdrawn, without an explanation as to why. Several days later I was told the funds were no longer in the account, but the branch manager was not able to provide an explanation. For the next few weeks I made numerous calls to Truist corporate offices and my local branch, and visited the branch numerous times to ascertain the whereabouts of my funds. In late XXXX I was advised by XXXX XXXX that Truist had declined to open the account and that money I deposited would be returned, but was given conflicting accounts as to how the money would be returned, and when. After repeatedly contacting the corporate and local offices, in early XXXX I was told that the money had been sent via check on XX/XX/XXXX, via regular mail, to my home address, with an explanation of why the account was refused and the reason for the delay. After several weeks of waiting for the check to arrive, which did not happen, on XX/XX/XXXX I asked the bank to cancel the check and issue a new check, and was told by XXXX XXXX XXXX at Truist HQ ( XXXX ) the bank can not cancel checks, but that after 3 months from the supposed mailing date I could claim the loss and petition to have a new check.

Inaccurate credit reports directly impair the efficiency of the banking system, and unfair credit reporting methods undermine the public confidence, which is essential to the continued functioning of the banking system.

So whenever there is a violation under the FCRA, it impairs the efficiency of the banking system. This is a violation of my privacy with my consumer report, since I control what is listed and what is not.

This is a violation of both 15 U.S. Code 1681b ( 2 ) and 15 U.S. Code 1681c-2. This leads way to civil liability against the credit reporting agency for negligent and willful noncompliance under 15 U.S. Code 1681n, which allows for {$1000.00} per violation, for each account listed without my expressed written consent.

I looked at my consumer reports and noticed accounts I never gave anyone permission to report. Consumer reporting agencies have assumed a vital role and have a responsibility to report consumer information to the best of their ability with maximum possible accuracy like the Fair Credit Reporting Act clearly states.

Nature of the Complaint : 1. Inaccurate Reporting : The late payments listed on my credit report are inaccurate. I have consistently made my payments on time, as I have been enrolled in autopay for all my accounts.

2. Violation of the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) : The inaccurate reporting of these late payments violates my rights under the FCRA ( 15 USC 1666 ( b ) ), as they misrepresent my creditworthiness.

3. Potential Violation of Fair Debt Collections Practices Act ( FDCPA ) : The reporting of false late payments may also constitute a violation of the FDCPA, which protects consumers from misrepresentation regarding their accounts. 4. Truth in Lending Act ( TILA ) : I ass
ert that the reporting practices violate the TILA, which mandates accurate reporting of credit information.

Additionally, the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), specifically sections 15 U.S. Code 1681i and 15 U.S. Code 1681s-2, mandates that credit reporting agencies and information furnishers correct any inaccurate or incomplete information in credit reports and ensure the maximum accuracy of information contained in consumer files.

Despite submitting XXXX previous requests for correction on XX/XX/year> and XX/XX/year>, the information remains incorrect, constituting a violation of the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) and the Truth in Lending Act ( TILA ). 
Evidence of Error : In reviewing the two-year payment history provided by TransUnion, a 30-day late payment is inaccurately noted for XX/XX/year>. However : Payment records confirm that the payment was made within the grace period. 
No delinquency notices were issued for this period.

The reported 30-day late payment violates 15 U.S.C. 1681i, which requires credit reporting agencies to ensure maximum possible accuracy of the information in consumer files.

As stipulated by 15 U.S.C. 1666b, creditors must provide periodic statements at least 21 days before the payment due date. The failure to correct this error suggests non-compliance with these legal requirements.

Legal Violations : FCRA : 15 U.S.C. 1681i mandates that credit bureaus investigate disputes thoroughly and correct inaccuracies. The persistence of this error demonstrates a failure to fulfill this obligation.

TILA : The inaccurate reporting undermines the Truth in Lending Acts aim to ensure fair and accurate disclosures to consumers.

PAANL : The Protection Against Non-Payment of Obligations Act further reinforces the necessity of providing accurate and timely statements to avoid penalties to consumers, which was not adhered to in this case. 
Desired Resolution : I am requesting the following corrective actions : Immediate removal of the inaccurate 30-day late payment notation for XX/XX/year>. 
Written confirmation of the correction from TransUnion.

Verification of the updated report to ensure the information reflects my actual payment history accurately.

If this issue is not resolved promptly, I will escalate my complaint to include filing additional complaints with the CFPB and other relevant agencies, and I may explore legal remedies to address the harm caused by this error. 
Thank you for your immediate attention to this matter. Please confirm receipt of this complaint and provide a timeline for resolution.

Consequently, I am compelled to inform you that I will report { insert creditor } to the IRS for potential tax fraud using Form 3949-A if prompt action is not taken. As per IRS regulations, a canceled debt of {$600.00} or more necessitates the filing of a 1099-C form by federal or government agencies, or applicable financial entities. Failure to comply with this requirement constitutes tax fraud, a serious offense that I will not hesitate to report to the IRS. It is essential to understand that a canceled debt is considered ordinary income by the IRS. Consequently, any failure to file a 1099-C form, or any attempt to conceal such actions, constitutes inaccurate reporting.

Your company 's actions are in clear violation of the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), specifically 15 USC 1681s-2, which outlines the responsibilities of furnishers of information to consumer reporting agencies.

I have been told that 11 payments were extended. I have asked for the extension paperwork which I have not received. Extensions were explained to me that they go on the back of the loan which extends the length of time that I pay for the car. 

My issue is that the balance owed is incorrect, which makes it look as if I am not paying for the car. When I looked at my XXXX credit report it states incorrectly that I have only made one payment, since XXXX, which is not correct and the car would have been repossessed.

However, instead of reaching out to XXXX XXXX to resolve the matter, XXXX took the following actions that I believe are illegal and unethical : XXXXXXXX XXXXSale of Debt to CollectionsXXXX : XXXX sold my debt to a collections agency without properly notifying me or allowing me the opportunity to address the situation with my insurance provider. This action has severely impacted my credit score and financial standing.

I have documentation that includes a notice of deficiency and a notice of their plan to sell the property. Additionally, I have a receipt from XXXX XXXX and XXXX, which confirms that they picked up the vehicle, and a police report detailing the incident. 

XXXX. XXXXUnjust Expectation of PaymentXXXX : After selling the vehicle and applying the sale proceeds, XXXX is now expecting me to pay a balance on a vehicle that was totaled. This expectation is not only unreasonable but also places an undue financial burden on me. 

I believe that XXXX actions violate consumer protection laws and regulations, and I am seeking your assistance in addressing this matter. I request that the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau investigate this situation and take appropriate action against XXXX for their improper practices.

The account in question is XXXX  XXXX XXXX ( Original Creditor : XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX account number XXXX.

Failure to Notify ( FCRA 611 ( a ) ( 5 ) ( B ) ( ii ) ) : If reinserted, the CRA must notify me in writing within 5 business days. I received no such notification.

Failure to Investigate Disputes ( FCRA 611 ( a ) ( 1 ) ) : Both CRAs failed to conduct a reasonable investigation before re-adding this account.

The improper re-insertion of this unverifiable debt has caused harm to my credit score and overall financial standing. The failure of Experian and XXXX to comply with the FCRA has also caused undue stress.

Summary of Issues Failure to Remove Debt Balance After Sale : After my vehicle was repossessed and sold, the balance of the debt was not adjusted or removed as required. Despite the sale, the remaining balance has continued to be inaccurately reported.

Resale of Debt and Duplicate Reporting : The original debt was subsequently sold to another lender, and both the original and new debts are being reported on my credit file as active, resulting in a duplicate entry that significantly impacts my credit score. 

Lack of Proper Notice and Validation : I have not received proper notice, validation, or documentation of the debt 's accuracy from either the original creditor or the subsequent debt buyer. 

Violations of Consumer Protection Laws 15 U.S. Code 1681b : Credit reports must be accurate, and lenders must have a permissible purpose to report debts. The duplicate reporting of this debt and its inaccuracies violate this requirement.

15 U.S. Code 1681n : The continued reporting of incorrect debt balances and duplicates suggests willful noncompliance with the FCRA.

15 U.S. Code 1681o : At the very least, the handling of this debt reflects negligent noncompliance, causing significant harm to my credit standing.

Uniform Commercial Code ( UCC ) 9-610 and 9-611 : The sale of repossessed property requires creditors to provide notice of sale and ensure commercial reasonableness. If proper notice was not given, this could constitute another violation.

Today ( XXXX XXXX, 2015 ) I received a letter from Synchrony Bank concerning a credit due to my credit card account ending in XXXX. The letter states that "" According to our records, your credit of {$960.00} was applied to your account on XXXX/XXXX/2015. You can find this credit on a previous billing statement. '' The letter was sent from the Customer Service Department. Having all my previous statements in hand, I know the above quote from the letter is patently false. 
I called Customer Service yet again today to ask them to explain the letter and point me to the statement that contained the applied credit. I spoke with customer rep "" XXXX '' who told me that the letter was not in error-that it referred to when I opened the dispute. Clearly the letter says nothing of the sort. She absolutely would not concede that the letter was in error in stating that the credit was applied to my account on XXXX/XXXX/2015. 
Noting it was clearly futile to argue the point, it is clear to me that this is an effort to XXXX on the part of Synchrony Bank in anticipating a complaint investigation. I highly resent these tactics, given the time and consternation this has caused me in this matter. A simple "" mea culpa '' admission and correcting the matter would suffice.

This account has been repeatedly disputed without adequate verification, in clear violation of the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ). Despite multiple requests for investigation and correction, the credit bureau has failed to comply with the thorough and reasonable verification requirements under the FCRA, relying solely on automated and inconsistent responses. 
Inconsistency Reporting : I have identified inconsistencies in the information for this account across all three major credit bureau reports. The discrepancies suggest that the reported information is inaccurate and does not meet the FCRA 's accuracy standards, warranting immediate corrective action. 
Legal Basis and Violations of the FCRA 1. Inaccuracy and Lack of Verification : According to the FCRA, credit bureaus must maintain accurate and verifiable information in credit reports. In this case, the credit bureau has shown a lack of diligence in verifying this account, relying solely on automated systems like e-OSCAR to respond to my dispute. This type of system does not meet the reasonable verification standard required by law, especially in a recurring dispute that significantly impacts my credit history and score. 
XXXX. Inconsistencies Across Credit Bureaus : Upon reviewing my reports from the three major credit bureaus, I have found inconsistencies in how this account is reported.

XXXX ) : This ruling establishes that credit bureaus must conduct reasonable investigations and can not rely solely on automated responses when a consumer disputes the accuracy of reported information.

These two companies are developed and mined in the United States. I found out later, after I invested my money that CRYTO.COM is a foreign company base out of XXXX. They take your money, charge enormous fees and seize your money and do not allow the patron to invest in the bitcoin of their choice. Then they make it almost impossible to make withdraws back to your Bank account as your given ultimatums to sign their forms after you have already made several deposits. Then they seize your money for 180 days so they will use the patrons money to make money for themselves at interest rates very high and invest the patrons money in risky bitcoin. Then if their is a loss in the invest ment the patron losses their money, but if their is a large profit Crypto.com keeps the profit for themselves on a daily bases and pay the patron only 10 % on any funds left in their account aAT THE END OF THE 180 days, So you are lead to believe you have control of your own funds, that is, until the deposit is made then you basically lose all control of your invested funds and receive a Debit /Visa card in the mail two weeks later that you can not withdraw any funds from until 180 days later. 

So you have no control of your invested money and trying to get help or speak to a real person about your problem is difficult at best. After about 20 tries with the number they give and going through a difficult set of questions im told i will receive a phone call back or an ema I l of some type investigating the problem. 
However if you say to the machine that you are a new customer wanting to invest money, ha, well after about a 30 minute hold time your put through to a young man who speaks broken English only knows how to say "" NO ''. 

He said my money was locked away and I could not withdrawn Any funds until 180 days later because he said the money was, "" Stake funding ''. 

However, if their are any losses from the. investments of your funds you lose your money, as the money seems to deplete slowly at times and jumps back and forth- up & down. 

This company named CRYPTO.COM makes money regardless of the patrons losses or gain. So say at the end of the 180 days your {$5000.00} investment is down to say {$1500.00}. They promise to pay you 10 % of that balance for using your money!. And the young man said their was no way I could invest my own money or get my original investment of {$5000.00} back just days after I tried using their complicated format which leads the patron into unwittingly allowing CRYTO.COM full control of your money to invest or spend your money on reckless investments, which can lead to the loss of your entire funds. I feel like this is a new start up company and do not yet have the platform to invest anyone 's money. 
I really believe this company should be sanctioned from doing business in the United States as Older investors or military personnel could invest in this company that imitates an established investment brokerage company. 

Then when they are deployed and need their funds they would not have the ability to withdraw their funds. The funds would either tied up for 180 days or gone because of risky uneducated investing by novice unregistered brokers. Why?

2025-01-08,Checking or savings account,Checking account,Managing an account,Banking errors,"To Whom It May Concern, I am writing to file a formal complaint against MidFirst Bank, which has subjected me to a series of deeply troubling and unethical practices that have caused significant financial and emotional harm. I am currently battling XXXX XXXX, which has made an already difficult situation even more unbearable. The following is a summary of my experience : Unjust Closure of My Claim : After I filed a legitimate claim, MidFirst Bank closed it within one business day without providing any explanation or documentation. This lack of transparency and accountability left me deeply frustrated. To my dismay, the bank later reopened the claim without my consent or involvement, further exacerbating the situation. 

Denial of Communication and Gaslighting : When I contacted customer service to seek clarification, I was met with outright denial. The representatives insisted that my claim had never been closed, which left me feeling completely gaslighted, as though my experience and concerns were of no importance to them. 

Disrespectful and Inhumane Treatment : During one phone call with a representative, who was aware the call was being recorded, I was subjected to laughter and mockery when I explained the distress I was facing, including my financial struggles and the very real threat of homelessness and frostbite. I had hoped for empathy from a professional institution, but instead, I was met with ridicule and a complete lack of compassion. 

Unnotified Account Closure : My account was closed suddenly, without any prior notice or communication from the bank. This left me unable to access the funds I desperately needed, including money to pay my rent. When I attempted to deposit cash directly into my account, I was refused, which resulted in additional fees and left me overdrawn with no means of resolving the situation. 

Discriminatory Treatment : The banks staff treated me with hostility and disdain, behavior which I believe to be discriminatory and unprofessional. This treatment has left me feeling not only financially destitute but also emotionally shattered, as if my dignity and well-being no longer matter to the institution. 

XXXX XXXX : In addition to the above, I am battling XXXX XXXX, a condition that has made dealing with this situation even more distressing. The emotional toll of this experience, combined with the physical toll of my XXXX, has left me feeling isolated and powerless. 

MidFirst Banks actions have not only caused significant financial harm but have also led to an emotional crisis. Their refusal to follow established procedures, coupled with their treatment of me as less than human, has shattered my trust in the banking system.

Background I am disputing fraudulent accounts linked to identity theft that occurred in XXXX, XXXX, XXXX years ago. I have submitted a valid FTC Identity Theft Report. 

However, ChexSystems has : - Labeled my dispute as frivolous and failed to investigate thoroughly. 
- Refused to block fraudulent trade lines despite the clear evidence of identity theft. 
- Requested unreasonable documentation ( a police report from XXXX authorities or a law enforcement-signed FTC Identity Theft Report ), which is not feasible for me to provide. 

Unreasonable Demands for Documentation - ChexSystems ' request for a police report from XXXX XXXX XXXX Police or a law enforcement-signed FTC Identity Theft Report is unreasonable, as the identity theft occurred outside of the XXXX, XXXX XXXX, XXXX. It is impractical for a XXXX XXXX XXXX to sign an FTC report or provide a local police report for an international incident. This is a burden on consumers that should not be required, especially when an FTC Identity Theft Report is already available. 

FCRA XXXX ChexSystems actions continue to violate the FCRA in the following ways : Failure to Conduct a Reasonable Investigation ( FCRA 611 ) : - The company failed to reinvestigate properly, relying only on the information from the reporting institutions.

- Failure to Block Fraudulent Information ( FCRA 605B ) : ChexSystems has not acted on the FTC report and continues to require unnecessary documentation.

Failure to Ensure Accuracy ( FCRA 607 ( b ) ) : - The company has not ensured the accuracy and completeness of my consumer report, despite the evidence provided.

2024-12-10,Credit reporting or other personal consumer reports,Credit reporting,Incorrect information on your report,Account status incorrect,"I am filing this complaint regarding XXXX key issues involving inaccurate information that Truist Bank reported to the credit bureaus. These errors have significantly impacted my credit score and directly affected my ability to qualify for a Small Business Administration ( SBA ) loan that is essential for my business operations. Despite multiple attempts to resolve this with Truist Bank over the past XXXX months, I have not received any reasonable explanation or corrective action. Below is a detailed summary of the issues, including the actions I have taken and Truist 's responses. 
XXXX. Inaccurate Reporting of an Active Account as "" Closed '' On or around XX/XX/year>, I discovered that XXXX of my active accounts with Truist Bank had been incorrectly reported as "" closed '' to the major credit reporting agencies ( XXXX, XXXX, and XXXX ). This is factually incorrect because the account is still active, in good standing, and I continue to use it regularly. 
My Actions : I contacted Truist Bank as soon as I discovered this error. 
I provided clear, undeniable proof that the account was active and in use, including : Account statements showing regular activity and ongoing use. 
Screenshots and transaction records confirming the account is open and functional. 
Truist 's Response : Truist responded with a letter stating that "" the disputed account information is accurate as reported '' and that "" there are no changes necessary. '' This response was incorrect and dismissive, as the evidence I provided clearly showed that the account is still active and in use. 
Despite my efforts to escalate the matter, Truist has failed to correct the status of the account, which remains inaccurately reported as "" closed '' on my credit report. 
Impact of This Error : This false reporting has caused a significant drop in my credit score, impacting my ability to obtain financing for my business. 
As a result, I was unable to qualify for an SBA loan that was critical for expanding my business operations. 
This delay has caused serious financial harm to my business and has put me in a position where I am unable to meet my business goals. 
XXXX. Refusal to Remove a Late Payment from a Secured Credit Card The second issue relates to a misunderstanding regarding an expired secured credit card that had a XXXX balance. After the card expired, I was unaware that an annual fee was still owed, as it was not clearly communicated by Truist. This led to a late payment being reported on my credit report. 
My Actions : As soon as I became aware of the balance, I made the payment in full immediately. 
I reached out to Truist Bank to request a "" goodwill adjustment '' for the late payment. I explained that : The card had expired, and I believed I owed nothing, as the balance was XXXX. 
I had a strong history of on-time payments with Truist. 
I made the payment as soon as I realized the mistake. 
Truist 's Response : Truist issued a response stating that "" the information you are disputing was furnished correctly '' and that they would not remove the late payment from my report. 
They did not acknowledge my long history of responsible payments or the goodwill request I made to have the late payment removed. 
I requested clarification of their policy on charging annual fees after a secured credit card expires, but Truist did not provide any explanation or documentation in response. 
Impact of This Error : This late payment was reported to all three major credit bureaus, causing a further drop in my credit score.

This, in combination with the false closed account status, has significantly limited my ability to access financing, particularly an SBA loan essential to my business operations.

The inability to secure this financing has caused serious financial hardship for my business, delaying important projects and creating unnecessary financial strain.

Summary of My Requests Correct the inaccurate "" closed '' status of my active account and report it as "" active '' to all credit bureaus.

2020-06-24,Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Applying for a mortgage or refinancing an existing mortgage,,"As a first time home buyer, I was looking for a house in XXXX. I ended up with XXXX XXXX and they routed me to one of their preferred lenders US Bank. I went with them for pre-approval for signing the purchase agreement with the builder in the month of XXXX. I was given initial disclosure on the loan estimate on XX/XX/XXXX though their promised lender credit missing. For every question I asked, there were no clear explanation given on credits not being applied. The interest rate offered for my credit score was 3.875 % In the month of XXXX, they re-opened my loan file. I kept asking them for the new interest rate and the revised loan estimate to do rate shopping. The lender never gave the revised loan estimate and stopped me from rate shopping. They said my credit score would drop and I would not be eligible for the loan program. Inspite of that I went ahead with rate shopping with one of the other preferred lender of the builder XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX with my initial disclosure form US bank. Immediately US bank ordered the appraisal without giving me any room for rate  discussion. I found out XXXX was offering good MI for 3.25 % interest rate. US bank said they can give the same interest rate but never bothered about the MI and also said I will lose my appraisal amount. On XX/XX/XXXX I got the Loan estimate from XXXX and gave it to US bank to check if they can beat the rate and MI. On XX/XX/XXXX, US bank came up with loan estimate with 3.125 % interest rate still with high MI. So I decided to proceed with XXXX and inform the builder the same. XXXX repriced the rate and gave back lot of credits so less Cash to close with a difference of $ XXXXmonth on MI from US bank. In the mean time, US bank kept me in immense stress everyday by not replying emails and answering calls. They said they can not pull the credit report again. If they pull it, then would be able to match XXXX   MI.To keep me with US bank, they promised they will give 2.875 % interest rate so that they can match the XXXX MI as US bank MI couldn't be changed.

This is when US bank started with the plot. They changed the loan program from 97 % conventional to Home possible from XXXX XXXX.I never knew that it has a income limit. Later understood it was a plot to hook me up with a wrong program under lucrative interest rate. I dropped from XXXX and informed the builder I will be going with US bank. US bank again started playing the games on the loan estimate. Without my consent, they charged points to bring down the rates to 2.875 % and the rate was locked. US Bank management didn't agree to give me back the charged amount in the closing costs. Cash to close kept creeping up and they didn't heed to any of the closing costs concerns. 

As the bank was preparing all the documents for the closing date XXXX XXXX, On XX/XX/XXXX there was a sudden inquiry in my credit report. I called equifax to see who made the query. They said it was made by US bank. And it was done with no prior information and without my consent. I asked US bank why don't they fix the MI then, since they have latest report. I kept the file in pending status. I was informed the file will be ready on Monday which is the closing date.

I asked my wife to take off from her work. There was no reply from US bank on Monday other than underwriter is still looking into the file.No response to emails or calls as usual to keep us under immense stress. I asked my wife to take another day off hoping that it will be completed the next day. There was no response and finally Tuesday evening and said I am no longer eligible for the loan program because of the income limit. So they have to give the interest rate as on date with higher MI than before. I was in deep distress since they said rate lock is not valid under the old program. They said they will check with their management. 

They never responded back till Friday. I informed my apartment that I will move out in the weekend. They had a new tenant signed for my rest of the lease, so I didn't have any rent obligation for the rest of the lease. With the delay going on closing the loan, I was forced to change the move out date. The Apartment office called me and said, they lost the tenant with change in dates, so its my obligation to pay the rent for the rest of the months. 

I decided to check with XXXX if they went with right Loan program. They said they have gone with correct loan program and they are still with same interest rate and same MI.I was happy to move with them. Even then US bank instead of giving the promised rate, asked me to cancel XXXX application so that they can close the house with promising any any change in the interest rate/MI/Closing costs.

Inaccurate credit reports directly impair the efficiency of the banking system, and unfair credit reporting methods undermine the public confidence, which is essential to the continued functioning of the banking system.

So whenever there is a violation under the FCRA, it impairs the efficiency of the banking system. This is a violation of my privacy with my consumer report, since I control what is listed and what is not. In the event that any accounts are reported without my written consent, that is considered identity theft. 

This is a violation of both 15 U.S. Code 1681b ( 2 ) and 15 U.S. Code 1681c-2. This leads way to civil liability against the credit reporting agency for negligent and willful noncompliance under 15 U.S. Code 1681n, which allows for {$1000.00} per violation, for each account listed without my expressed written consent.

I spoke to someone today who told me dont you notice the extra {$200.00} in your account every month or what?! To which I found quite displeasing and subsequently the gentleman stopped allowing me to speak, kept interrupting me and hung up on me saying he will have his manager call me as he cant do anything. 

How can I be taken to court without notice, without due diligence and without the opportunity to have been put back on the plan or give them the new bank account number that I created to avoid these issues w the bank in the future. 

The firm has a bad reputation for taking people to court and no notice and garnishing wages without due process and this is happening to me and I am asking for help!

I was unfortunately XXXX  during my birthday celebration, I was found XXXX  on the streets by the local police and was taken to a nearby hospital, upon waking up ( about 8 - 10 hours later ) I opened my eyes to be found in a hospital bed, not knowing how I got there. 

The Hospital did a XXXX XXXX  and determined that I was XXXX, the report from the hospital talks about how and what condition I was found I mentioned this as this is the reason for the complaint against Wells Fargo, during the time I was on the hospital and after with no phone, no money, and access to my accounts, the people who XXXX  me got into my bank accounts ( business XXXX XXXX, XXXX, personal Account, and my Wells Fargo Credit Card, XXXX, XXXX, XXXX XXXX ) and drained my accounts to XXXX in less than 24 hours. I was not able to get back into the states until I was able to get an emergency passport from the US Embassy in XXXX XXXX. 

Upon my arrival in XXXX XXXX, the very first thing I did was to visit my local bank on XX/XX/year>, where I filed multiple complaints for fraudulent activity. 

I showed up at the branch, and while I waited to be seeing, I also was on the phone filing my claims, ( I probably spend over 3 hours at the branch ) Ive explained my situation to the person on the phone ( multiple people ) and to the banker ( XXXX XXXX ). My bank accounts were all drained ( {$16.00}, XXXX from my business account, {$1400.00} from my personal account, $ XXXX from my credit card ), and there numerous transactions back and forth between my credit card, personal account, and business account. 

It was determined that indeed there was fraudulent activity, and the branch requested copies of the reports which were rendered and provided to the branch ( a copy of my police report, hospital report, copy of my emergency passport ) to only find out on the XXXX of this XXXX that the claims department never received the full story and never received any of my reports. 

On this day my bank accounts and credit card were closed, and new accounts ( business and personal ) and credit card were open. This was on XXXX of XXXX, Ive left with the instructions that the bank will open an investigation. Come the XXXX, I could not access my online banking, and was asked to go back to the branch so they can verify me. I was not able to get into the branch until the XXXX of XXXX and unfortunately there was not much to be done as the department that could help me was closed and was asked to come back on Monday. I came back and that was another lengthy visit to the branch as I was somehow flagged in the system as XXXX  and therefore I had no access to my online banking. The banker at the branch spent a lot of time trying to get an answer for me and was not able to get anywhere and the branch manager got involved. It took over 12 people to get my situation figured out, there was a huge lack of incompetence at the customer service level, where we were being bounced back between tech, XXXX, and online department. As a matter of fact, the branch manager was also frustrated with the lack of service from her own company and filed several complaints on my behalf. Nevertheless, my only access was finally granted, and now it was a matter of waiting on the response from their investigation into my numerous claims. 

As the days went by, I had not received any new ATMs for my personal and business, or even a new credit card. I came to find out again someone dropped the ball as those never requested to begin with, again the level of incompetence and attention to detail to my matter and or case. Now, all these are the least of my worries, I was very surprised to see correspondence from the bank saying that they did their investigation and found that the transaction was authorized and therefore did not find any fraudulent activity. I immediately called customer service to inquire as to why they closed the case and came to find out that one they will not re-open and two they had never received the details of information I had given to numerous people over the phone or at the branch level and said they never received the documents, banking up my case. 

I feel that they have not done their due diligence and investigated this matter as if they should or give this the level of importance that they should be. To begin with they could clearly see that the activity that took place on the XXXX has never happened on my account, to completely clear my account to zero and not just my personal also my business. If someone was truly investigating this with the back up documentation and with the type of activity they would clearly see this was fraud and my money should be protected. Never have I done in less than 24 hours ( probably even less than that ) have Ive done one wire transfer, nine XXXX transaction, moving money from my personal to business, from my personal to my credit card, from my business to my personal, looking at ways to just drained my account. 

As a consumer, and a victim of fraud, being XXXX, and assaulted, I am requesting some help and assistance in recouping what was taken from me, and at the minimum a fair review and investigation. 

I am requesting a further and in-depth review, and for all my money, if not some, to be returned to me under the protection and insurance that the bank has for its customers.

Despite my multiple submissions of the required documentation as a victim of human trafficking, Experian continues to deny my request to block adverse information from my credit file.

Specifically, I have provided : A self-attestation letter signed by both myself and an authorized officer from an authorized agency.

A victim determination letter, also signed by myself and the authorized agency.

These documents have been submitted to Experian on three or four separate occasions. While both XXXX and XXXX accepted the same documentation and blocked the adverse information as required under Section 605C, Experian has refused to do so. This has caused significant inconsistencies across my credit reports and continues to harm my financial standing. 

Experian has repeatedly sent me identical, automated responses, despite my compliance with all legal requirements for exercising my rights under the FCRA. It appears there has been no meaningful human review of my case, yet the only denial reason they give is for me to submit a victim determination letter even though I have sent it to them on numerous occasions I respectfully request that the CFPB : 1. Investigate the methods and tools Experian is using to determine its denial of my request to block adverse information.

2. Require Experian to conduct a human review of my case, as their automated responses fail to address the merits of my documentation and circumstances.

3. Ensure Experian complies with its obligations under Section 605C of the FCRA, as both XXXX and XXXX have already done. 

As a victim of trafficking, I should not be subjected to this repeated and unjust denial of my rights, especially after providing all required documentation multiple times. I urge the CFPB to intervene and hold Experian accountable for its obligations under the law.

These accounts are causing significant damage to my financial reputation and overall well-being. It is evident that the inclusion of these fraudulent items violates 15 USC 1681b regarding permissible purposes, as the credit bureaus have no legitimate reason to report them without my explicit consent. Please refer to the attached file detailing these items I am disputing.

The Fair Credit Reporting Act ( 15 U.S. Code 1681 ) says ( 1 ) The banking system is dependent upon fair and accurate credit reporting. Inaccurate credit reports directly impair the efficiency of the banking system, and unfair credit reporting methods undermine the public confidence, which is essential to the continued functioning of the banking system. So whenever there is a violation under the FCRA, it impairs the efficiency of the banking system. This is a violation of my privacy with my consumer report, since I control what is listed and what is not. In the event that any accounts are reported without my written consent, that is considered identity theft.

This XXXX XXXX on Purchases fee is dated/posted XX/XX/XXXX, yet it did not appear on my XXXX bill which last transaction was posted XX/XX/XXXX. They slipped in this unjustified charge without me seeing it. I discovered it over last weekend when I happened to log in online to look at recent charges. Elan is determined to get some interest from me since for the past 2 years 10 months I have had this business Visa through them, I have always paid my balance off each month in full. Never has there been yet even {$1.00} balance left unpaid. 
I called Elan on this wrong interest charge yesterday. XXXX XXXX XXXX said it was for XXXX days late on the XXXX bill payment that was due XXXX XXXX. Let me explain that this was still unjustified. First, let me note the fact, as my previous statements revealed, that they did the same thing to me in XX/XX/XXXX with an unjustified Interest charge of {$70.00}, when my payment was not late. They were hoping that charged wrongfully slipped in that I would not catch. But I did catch it and I called then about that interest charge, and the XXXX waived it and credited back to me. If it was a justified charge, they would not have credited back to me. Now 13 months forward, they did the same thing but this time they did not waive it. Why is it unjustified? CSRs claim was it was based on the payment be late 3 days. But she admitted it was received on Mon. XXXX XXXX. So XXXX XXXX should not be counted as a day. Second, the day before is a Sunday, and XXXX is closed on Sunday. Sunday should not be counted either, for this is penalizing customers for the business being closed on Sunday! Thirdly, the fact is, I mailed this bill by XXXX on Monday XXXX XXXX. And it should have arrived by XXXX. It is clear that XXXX is trying to get some unjustified interest money from me. Lastly, the balance of this XXXX bill due XXXX XXXX was {$1600.00}. It plain wrong to charge {$70.00} of interest for a bill the could have been 2 days late ( but XXXX not even have been late and this could be a sheer corruption charge.

I make this statement to the best of my knowledge and abilities and do not do so under duress or to unjustly gain any products or services mentioned or itemized in the attached evidence : Unauthorized Charges : I have identified unauthorized charges on my credit card accounts. I have not received any products or services corresponding to these charges. I did not sign up for, approve, or knowingly allow anyone to use my credit cards for these transactions. 

Lost/Stolen Device : One of my two personal telephones was recently lost or stolen while traveling. I have no idea who has it but did notice, according to the device activity, that someone has accessed the device while it was not in my possession. I keep two devices, one for work and one for personal use. While I use a password manager, LastPass, to securely store my passwords, I try to keep my PIN numbers memorized. However, having access to my phone would allow someone to circumvent two-step authentication by receiving text messages. It appears that most of the online charges were made with a debit card, which does not require the PIN. 

Viruses and Malware : Several viruses and malware were discovered and quarantined by the antivirus software on my computer, which was syncing with my phone. 

XXXX Account Breach : My XXXX account was also taken over. The perpetrators attempted to list items and make purchases under my name, directing these activities to my XXXX account, which they also accessed. XXXX noticed these unauthorized activities immediately and locked them out of my account. I do not know the details of what they did on XXXX during the period they had access or how XXXX became aware of the breach, but I am surprised that no banks alerted me or questioned the out-of-pattern transactions that XXXX noticed immediately. 

Mailbox Break-In : My mailbox was broken into and has since been repaired. See the attached photo of the mailbox destruction. I have no idea how or why they managed to do this or why they would target my mailbox. It is strange because a few times there has been a strange person sitting in the hallway outside of my apartment. When I asked him what he was doing there, he said his girlfriend kicked him out. This seems very sketchy to me. The building is a secure building and requires a key for every door and the elevators. You can not access my floor without a key, the same with the mailbox area. I have never seen him before and know many of my neighbors. 

Immediate Actions : Upon discovering the unauthorized charges, I immediately checked all my credit card accounts, made a list of all the unauthorized charges, and began the process of canceling the affected credit cards. Based on recommendations, I have also created new email addresses, reset all passwords, and performed factory resets on all my devices to prevent further unauthorized access. 

Reporting and Legal Compliance : I have reported these unauthorized charges to my credit card companies and relevant authorities as promptly and efficiently as possible given the circumstances. I have acted to the best of my abilities in addressing this issue and have followed the prudent course of actions prescribed by law. 

Legal Rights and Timeliness : Considering that I am within the 60-day period from the date of the statements containing the unauthorized charges, and given the extenuating circumstances in my life, including moving and being involved in a contentious legal matter, I can not be held liable for these charges. According to the Fair Credit Billing Act ( FCBA ), 15 U.S.C. 1666, and California Civil Code 1747.50, I have reported these unauthorized charges within the legally required timeframe. The case law, such as Regulation Z, 12 C.F.R. 226.12 ( b ), supports that I am not liable for unauthorized use if I notify the issuer within a reasonable time after learning of the loss or theft of the card. Additionally, the Federal Trade Commission ( FTC ) and Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ) provide guidelines that protect consumers from being held liable for unauthorized charges if reported within the stipulated time frame. 

Bank Fraud Protection Guarantees : I am aware that several financial institutions, including XXXX, XXXX, and XXXX XXXX XXXX, offer fraud protection guarantees which assure that consumers are not held liable for unauthorized transactions if reported promptly. I have adhered to these policies by reporting the unauthorized charges as soon as they were discovered, thereby invoking the protection guaranteed by these institutions. 

XXXX XXXX  XXXX and cerulean bank both found in my favor. XXXX XXXX XXXX decided to collude with XXXX aka Skrill a payment processor and forged evidence. XXXX submitted the forgery to XXXX XXXX  XXXX who with me identified that it was fraud on XXXX XXXX part. XXXX admitted this and indicated they colluded with XXXX and XXXX. They proceeded to immediately refund the transactions after we caught them. They were dispicable to do this. I will never trust that company again. 

XXXX then tried to make it appears as they were attempting to refund the transactions to my XXXX account ; however, it was not known to me until later that they were colluding with XXXX because when I asked XXXX to refund the money to an account I had control of as the prevailing law dictates they refused. They then stopped talking to me and became very hostile. They attempted three times to refund the transactions, but it was no real because they knew XXXX was going to block them and not permit the refund. 

XXXX after being found out rather than make things right because they had taken such server actions against me decided to double down. They closed the account and declined to allow the refunds to be returned from XXXX. they froze and liquidated assets and caused sever distress and forced me to take over XXXX in losses from the fact that stocks and crypto were down when they forced the sales. that is absolutely horrific and nearly drove me to XXXX I was unable to pay bills or even access any of my money because of what these companies did.

2024-12-30,Credit reporting or other personal consumer reports,Credit reporting,Improper use of your report,Reporting company used your report improperly,"I am writing to dispute the accuracy and validity of a charge-off account that has been reported on my consumer report. Under the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), 15 U.S.C. 1681 et seq., I have the right to accurate and complete information in my credit reports. I believe the information regarding this charge-off account is inaccurate and/or incomplete, and I request an immediate investigation into this matter.

Potential Inaccuracies and Issues : 1. Chargeoff with {$0.00} Balance : o The account is marked as Collection/Chargeoff, but the balance is {$0.00}. This is inconsistent with the high credit of {$2400.00} and requires clarification.

2. Account Transferred or Sold : o The comment indicates the account was transferred or sold, but no information is provided about the new creditor or details of the transfer. This makes the report incomplete.

3. Payment History Inconsistency : o The two-year payment history is marked as OK for all months, even though the account status is listed as derogatory and charged off. This is contradictory and inaccurate. 
4. Future Reporting Date : o The "" Last Reported '' date is XX/XX/XXXX, which violates the FCRA 's requirement for timely and accurate reporting. 
5. Missing Information : o XXXX and TransUnion : The details for these bureaus are incomplete or missing entirely, which makes the report inconsistent across bureaus. 



XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX Potential Inaccuracies : 1. Chargeoff Status with {$0.00} Balance : o The account is listed as Charged off as bad debt with a {$0.00} balance. If the account was charged off, there should typically be a balance or further clarification on the transfer or resolution.

2. Missing Information on Transfer : o The comment Purchased by another lender lacks details. The new lender or purchaser should be listed, and this must be clarified in the account report.

3. Credit Limit Reporting : o A credit limit of {$0.00} is inconsistent with the reported high credit of {$5000.00}. This discrepancy may indicate inaccurate or incomplete data.

4. Future Reporting Dates : o The "" Last Reported '' date is XX/XX/XXXX, which is acceptable, but discrepancies in other accounts often show future dates that need careful review. 
XXXX. Incomplete Payment History : o The two-year payment history is blank, even though the account was open and reported as active until XX/XX/XXXX. This incomplete reporting violates FCRA Section 607 ( b ), which mandates accurate and complete information.

Applicable Legal Basis for Dispute 1. Verification Requirement ( 15 U.S.C. 1681i ) : - The FCRA mandates that all disputed information be verified within 30 days of a consumers dispute. If the information can not be verified, it must be corrected or deleted.

2. Obligation of Accuracy ( 15 U.S.C. 1681e ( b ) ) : - Consumer reporting agencies must ensure maximum possible accuracy of the information in consumer reports. The inaccurate or unverifiable information regarding the charge-off account violates this requirement.

3. Re-Aging of Debt ( 15 U.S.C. 1681c ) : - The FCRA prohibits re-aging of old debt. If the date of first delinquency is inaccurately reported, the charge-off may appear on my credit report longer than the allowed 7 years.

4. Validation of Debt ( Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, 15 U.S.C. 1692g ) : - Under the FDCPA, if the debt is being collected by a third party, I have the right to request validation of the debt, including proof of ownership and the amount owed.

2025-01-14,Credit reporting or other personal consumer reports,Credit reporting,Problem with a company's investigation into an existing problem,Investigation took more than 30 days,"To Whom It May Concern, I am writing to formally dispute the reporting of the closed credit card account referenced below, which is inaccurate and in violation of the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) ( 15 U.S.C. 1681 ). The account in question is being reported incorrectly by XXXX, XXXX, and Equifax, and I demand that it be immediately deleted from my credit reports. 

Account Information : Account Number ( redacted for security ) : XXXX Creditor Name : XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  Type : Credit Card Current Status : Closed ( by creditor due to inactivity ) High Balance : {$580.00} ( XXXX and XXXX ) ; {$500.00} ( Equifax XXXX Last Verified : XX/XX/year> Date Opened : XX/XX/year> to XX/XX/year> Date Closed : XX/XX/year> Balance Owed : {$560.00} Payment Status : Late 60 Days Discrepancies and Violations : Inaccurate Reporting of Credit Limit Under the FCRA ( 15 U.S.C . 1681c-2 ), a credit reporting agency is prohibited from reporting any credit limit for accounts that are closed, yet this account continues to report a {$500.00} credit limit despite being closed. This is a clear violation of the FCRA, as the credit limit reported is no longer relevant after the account has been closed.

Failure to Correct Reporting of Account Status The account is marked as "" Closed '' and the creditor 's remarks indicate that the account was "" canceled by credit grantor due to inactivity. '' However, the account is still being reported with incorrect late payment information. Under FCRA 15 U.S.C. 1681i ( a ) ( 1 ) ( A ), when an account is disputed, the creditor must correct the inaccuracies within 30 days of receiving the dispute. This account contains several incorrect and outdated details, including the reporting of late payments ( 60 days late ), which should not be on a closed account if it was paid off. 

Inaccurate Payment History The account is reported as being 60 days late across all three bureaus, even though the last payment was made on XX/XX/year> for XXXX and XXXX, and XX/XX/year> for Equifax. This inconsistency in reporting dates suggests an error or reporting delay and is misleading. 

Failure to Properly Verify Account Information The failure of XXXX, XXXX, and Equifax to ensure the accounts information is accurate violates FCRA Section 1681i, which mandates that they must correct or delete inaccurate information when the dispute is validated. The creditor has not properly verified the account details, as evidenced by the inconsistencies between the three reporting agencies.

Credit Reporting Post-Account Closure FCRA 15 U.S.C. 1681e ( b ) requires that the information reported is accurate, complete, and up-to-date. Reporting an account as open with a credit limit of {$500.00} when the account is closed and no longer active is a misrepresentation and is a violation of my consumer rights under the law.",,"EQUIFAX, INC.",MA,018XX,,Consent provided,Web,2025-01-14,Closed with non-monetary relief,Yes,N/A,11525821

This leads way to civil liability against the credit reporting agency for negligent and willful noncompliance under 15 U.S. Code 1681n, which allows for {$1000.00} per violation, for each account listed without my expressed written consent. 

I looked at my consumer reports and noticed accounts I never gave anyone permission to report.

The details of the claim are as follows : - **Claim ID : ** XXXX - **Claim Amount : ** {$5900.00} - **Claim Opened : ** XX/XX/year> Approximately a month ago, I presented Bank of America with sufficient and reasonable documentation supporting my request for a refund. The issues began when I initially booked my stay on the cruise ship, only to later discover that the room was no longer available and that I would have to accept a downgraded accommodation. The merchant informed me that while a refund for the initial booking was promised, securing a new room would necessitate an immediate additional payment. As such, I used my XXXX XXXX XXXX  ( ending in XXXX ) to pay for the downgraded room. 

Despite my attempts to secure a refund from XXXX XXXX, I have received no response to my numerous inquiries. However, after the dispute was initiated with Bank of America, I finally received acknowledgment from the merchant that they were reviewing my issue. I provided Bank of America with all relevant communications and evidence, yet my dispute was inexplicably closed in favor of XXXX XXXX  without a thorough investigation into the matter. 

I find Bank of Americas handling of my claim to be unprofessional and negligent. It is concerning that they closed my dispute without adequately considering the evidence presented. As a result, I am left without the funds owed to me.

Under 15 U.S.C. 1681e ( b ), credit reporting agencies are required to maintain reasonable procedures to ensure the accuracy of information on consumer reports. By allowing this erroneous account to appear on my report, the credit bureaus have failed in this statutory obligation. Furthermore, their failure to remove this account after I previously disputed it indicates a lack of reasonable reinvestigation under 15 U.S.C. 1681i ( a ).

Additionally, the willful and reckless nature of this reporting constitutes a violation of 15 U.S.C. 1681n, exposing the credit bureaus to liability for damages, statutory fines, and attorneys fees. The reporting of this account also creates unwarranted financial harm, as it misrepresents my creditworthiness and undermines my ability to access credit, housing, and other necessities.

I am requesting the CFPB to investigate this matter thoroughly and hold the credit bureaus accountable for their blatant disregard of federal law. Specifically, I ask that : This XXXX XXXX account ( # XXXX ) be permanently deleted from my credit file across all reporting agencies. 
The credit bureaus provide documentation of their procedures and investigations into this account as required under the FCRA. 
The CFPB impose appropriate penalties on the credit bureaus for their willful noncompliance with the law.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,"TRANSUNION INTERMEDIATE HOLDINGS, INC.",FL,XXXXX,,Consent provided,Web,2024-12-09,Closed with non-monetary relief,Yes,N/A,11086940

2. Conduct thorough investigations before taking actions that harm their clients.

After the dispute process, XXXX completed its investigation on XX/XX/year>, and completely deleted the accounts from my XXXX report. 

The disputed accounts in question were for the following amounts : {$590.00} account : XXXX {$760.00} account : XXXX As per the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), specifically Section 611, I am entitled to request the removal of any unverifiable or incorrect information from my credit report. Since XXXX has completely removed these charge-off accounts due to their inability to verify the debt, I believe it is in violation of consumer protection laws for these same unverifiable accounts to remain on my records with your agency. 

Given that XXXX has deleted these accounts due to their inability to verify the debt, I request that you conduct a thorough investigation into the matter and remove these unverifiable accounts from my credit report within 30 days or less. The Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) mandates that you correct or delete any unverifiable information within a reasonable time frame. Failure to comply with this request could result in legal actions. 

I would also like to remind you of the following legal protections under the FCRA : Section 611 of the FCRA : If any information is disputed by the consumer, the credit reporting agency must investigate the claim and, if the information can not be verified, must remove it from the consumers report within 30 days. 
Section 616 and 617 of the FCRA : If you willfully or negligently fail to comply with the requirements of the FCRA, I am entitled to pursue legal action, which may include suing for damages, as well as seeking statutory damages of up to {$1000.00} for willful violations.

Section 605 of the FCRA : The removal of unverifiable debt is not only a right but a requirement. If information is found to be inaccurate or unverifiable, it must be deleted promptly. 

Therefore, I respectfully request that you remove the two charge-off accounts from my credit report within 30 days due to their unverifiable nature. Should these accounts not be removed in the required timeframe, I will not hesitate to take legal action and will explore all available options to protect my rights under federal law. 

Please confirm the removal of these accounts in writing or by updating my credit report as soon as the investigation is complete.

Inaccurate credit reports directly impair the efficiency of the banking system, and unfair credit reporting methods undermine the public confidence which is essential to the continued functioning of the banking system.

So whenever there is a violation under the FCRA, it impairs the efficiency of the banking system. This is a violation of TILA US Code 1666B since I was never late. 

I recently reviewed my consumer report and noticed an incorrect late payment record on my XXXX XXXX  account [ XXXX ]. I have always maintained timely payments on this account. Under the Fair Credit Billing Act ( FCBA ) and the Truth in Lending Act ( TILA ), creditors are required to accurately report consumer transactions and provide a mechanism for correcting errors in a timely manner. Please conduct an investigation into this matter, and if you can not provide documentary evidence of these supposed late payments, I demand these payments to be updated to on time as they should be as I was NEVER late. I expect these updates to be made promptly, in compliance with the law.

Nature of the Complaint : XXXX. Inaccurate Reporting : The late payment listed on my credit report is inaccurate. I have consistently made my payments on time, as I have been enrolled in autopay for all my accounts. 
2. Violation of the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) : The inaccurate reporting of this late payment violates my rights under the FCRA ( 15 USC 1666 ( b ) ), as they misrepresent my creditworthiness.

3. Potential Violation of Fair Debt Collections Practices Act ( FDCPA ) : The reporting of false late payment may also constitute a violation of the FDCPA, which protects consumers from misrepresentation regarding their accounts.

4. Truth in Lending Act ( TILA ) : I assert that the reporting practices violate the TILA, which mandates accurate reporting of credit information.

Additionally, the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), specifically sections 15 U.S. Code 1681i and 15 U.S. Code 1681s-2, mandates that credit reporting agencies and information furnishers correct any inaccurate or incomplete information in credit reports and ensure the maximum accuracy of information contained in consumer files.

Furthermore, under the FCRA, articles 616 and 617 ( 15 U.S.C. 1681n and 1681o ) outline the civil liability for willful and negligent noncompliance, respectively. These provisions provide for damages, including actual damages, attorneys fees, and possible punitive damages, for failure to comply with the Act 's requirements.

Requested Resolution : I request that Transunion conduct a thorough investigation into this matter and remove the inaccurate late payment from my credit report. I ask that all such entries be updated to reflect my true payment history of 100 % on-time payments.

I expect to receive written documentation confirming the removal of this entries within 30 days of this complaint submission. Failure to resolve this issue may lead to further action to protect my rights as a consumer. 

Thank you for your immediate attention to this matter. 
Sincerely, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,"TRANSUNION INTERMEDIATE HOLDINGS, INC.",NJ,08611,,Consent provided,Web,2025-02-09,Closed with non-monetary relief,Yes,N/A,12007335

2025-01-13,Credit reporting or other personal consumer reports,Credit reporting,Incorrect information on your report,Account status incorrect,"In reviewing my account I noticed that the information that is listed on my credit report is extremely inaccurate in various fields. While I understand mistakes can happen unfortunately when it comes to financial data and credit reporting this is one industry where mistakes can cost the bearer extreme harm and distress. I request that the correct information be updated in the following fields : Balance, Past Due Amount, Last Reported Date, Date Last Active, Date of Last Payment.

Additionally there are several late payment indicators listed, which make no sense as to the best of my knowledge all payments have been submitted on time however seeing as I haven't been receiving my statements its nearly impossible for me to know the accuracy of the payments received. The following reporting periods need to be corrected as paid on time and the late payment indicators removed : XXXX XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX. It merits mentioning again, although I understand mistakes can happen the fact remains this misreporting of information to my credit report has caused me serious harm and also constitutes a violation of federal law, specifically 15 USC 1666b ( a ). I have not received a statement to my address on file as is a requirement under the law and that means the furnisher legally can not report my account late for any reason. Unless they are able to provide documented proof that the statements were mailed to me within the specified time frame under the statue any late payment indicators must be corrected. 

This dispute will serve as notice of the inaccurate information that is on my credit report for this account as well as the opportunity for your company to correct them without any additional action/enforcement on my behalf.

These disputes were not my first attempts to address these issues. I have previously disputed inaccurate information with both credit bureaus, but they failed to respond appropriately or investigate the accounts and inquiries in compliance with Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) requirements and Metro 2 ( M2 ) compliance standards. 

In my most recent dispute, I explicitly requested : 1. Verification of the accuracy and validity of the accounts, including supporting documentation from the original creditors. 


2. Evidence of proper investigation into each disputed item, as mandated by the FCRA.

3. Removal of unverifiable, inaccurate, or incomplete accounts and inquiries from my credit report.

4. Confirmation that any outdated or incorrect personal information, such as previous addresses or names, was deleted. 



Instead of conducting thorough investigations and providing the requested documentation, Experian and XXXX responded with generic form letters that did not resolve the inaccuracies or address my concerns. The disputed items include accounts and inquiries I do not recognize or that contain errors such as incorrect balances, dates, and statuses. 

The lack of proper investigation and resolution has negatively impacted my credit score, causing harm to my financial opportunities. Moreover, their failure to adhere to Metro 2 compliance guidelines and FCRA obligations demonstrates systemic shortcomings in their dispute resolution processes. 

As of today, the disputed information remains on my credit report, and I have not received any detailed documentation or an updated report reflecting the corrections I requested. This negligence is unacceptable, and I am seeking the CFPBs assistance to ensure that Experian and XXXX fulfill their legal obligations to investigate and correct inaccuracies promptly.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,Experian Information Solutions Inc.,TX,754XX,,Consent provided,Web,2025-01-27,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,11783308

I believe this late payment is erroneous and do not accurately reflect my payment history. 

Nature of the Complaint : XXXX. Inaccurate Reporting : The late payment listed on my credit report is inaccurate. I have consistently made my payments on time, as I have been enrolled in autopay for all my accounts. 
2. Violation of the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) : The inaccurate reporting of this late payment violates my rights under the FCRA ( 15 USC 1666 ( b ) ), as they misrepresent my creditworthiness.

3. Potential Violation of Fair Debt Collections Practices Act ( FDCPA ) : The reporting of false late payment may also constitute a violation of the FDCPA, which protects consumers from misrepresentation regarding their accounts.

4. Truth in Lending Act ( TILA ) : I assert that the reporting practices violate the TILA, which mandates accurate reporting of credit information.

Additionally, the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), specifically sections 15 U.S. Code 1681i and 15 U.S. Code 1681s-2, mandates that credit reporting agencies and information furnishers correct any inaccurate or incomplete information in credit reports and ensure the maximum accuracy of information contained in consumer files.

Furthermore, under the FCRA, articles 616 and 617 ( 15 U.S.C. 1681n and 1681o ) outline the civil liability for willful and negligent noncompliance, respectively. These provisions provide for damages, including actual damages, attorneys fees, and possible punitive damages, for failure to comply with the Act 's requirements.

Requested Resolution : I request that Transunion conduct a thorough investigation into this matter and remove the inaccurate late payment from my credit report. I ask that all such entries be updated to reflect my true payment history of 100 % on-time payments.

I expect to receive written documentation confirming the removal of this entries within 30 days of this complaint submission. Failure to resolve this issue may lead to further action to protect my rights as a consumer.

Attached is evidence that Celtic Bank through its affiliate Continental Finance intentionally generates bogus charges on both of my Celtic Bank credit card accounts. These charges grossly exceed the Military Lending Act of a MAPR of 36 % I have incurred significant financial losses because of this illegal conduct. As described in 10 USC 987, I am seeking restitution to cover my Losses 1. Acct # ending in XXXX XXXX credit cards 2. Acct # ending in XXXX XXXX credit card To protect our active-duty service members and their families, Congress declared that any violation of the XXXX renders that loan void from inception. 10 U.S.C. 987 ( f ) ( 3 ).

Accordingly, all of Agreements to a covered members that contain an MAPR that exceeds 36 percent are void, must be rescinded with restitution paid for all amounts.

I discovered that two credit cards provided to me by Celtic Bank violates The Military Lending Act, 10 U.S.C. 987, and the company refuses to address the matter in accordance with 10 USC 987. The law and statute were not followed by Celtic Bank through their affiliate Continental Finance. I am protected from predatory lending by Celtic Bank because of my borrower status under the Military Lending Act. 
All Active-duty service members and their dependents are Covered Borrowers as defined by 32 C.F.R. 232.3 ( g ) ( 1 ).

I allege Celtic Bank violates the MLA in at least six ( 2 ) separate ways : ( 1 ) Surpassing the 36 % Military Annual Percentage Rate ( MAPR ) statutory rate cap.

( 2 ) Non-compliance with MLA disclosure requirements.

Celtic Bank refusal to adhere to current law and statute, regarding this matter requires Celtics Bank immediate attention. As an internal remedy I request the deletion of the legally voided account from my credit report, the voiding of the contract, and the immediate return of all payments made to Celtic Bank, pursuant to 10 USC 987.

By suppressing the MLA 36 % cap, Celtic Bank has violated the MLA by not incorrectly including fees in its APR and surprising payment that generate an MAPR exceeding 90 %.

Celtic Bank combined made restitution for {$1300.00}. See attached statements.

Celtic Bank is required by 10 USC 987 to make restitution by refunding all payments made against the voided accounts and void the contract in their inception.

Despite my previous requests for validation and resolution of these discrepancies, it has come to my attention that a proper investigation was not conducted into the accuracy of these accounts. As a result, I request that you immediately remove these accounts from my credit report. 
On XX/XX/year>, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ) filed a lawsuit against your organization under Docket Number XXXX for violations related to the improper handling of consumer disputes, including the failure to conduct thorough and accurate investigations into consumer credit report discrepancies. Given the pending legal action and the clear indication of your failure to comply with the FCRAs investigation requirements, I respectfully request the immediate removal of the affected accounts from my credit file. 
As outlined in the CFPB lawsuit, your failure to properly investigate disputed information violates my consumer rights under federal law. As you are aware, the FCRA mandates that credit reporting agencies conduct a reasonable investigation upon receiving a dispute, and provide verified results in a timely manner. The failure to adhere to these provisions has caused significant harm to my creditworthiness, and I insist on the removal of the inaccurate accounts until such time as a proper investigation can be conducted.

Background 1. Fraudulent Account : The account in question is not mine. I am the victim of identity theft, and any claims that I owe this debt are fraudulent. 
2. Failure to Notify or Provide Verification : Midland Funding claims they mailed correspondence to me on XX/XX/year>, but I never received any such communication. This lack of notice and verification violates my rights under the FDCPA. 
XXXX. Violation of Cease-and-Desist Request : I explicitly requested Midland Funding to cease all communication and media activity regarding this fraudulent account. While they claimed they would cease contact, they continue to report negatively on my credit report. This is in direct violation of the FDCPA. 
4. Illegal Purchase of Account : If this account were legitimate ( which it is not ), Midland Funding violated my rights by purchasing an account without my knowledge or consent, which is illegal under federal law. Whoever sold the account is also in violation for unauthorized use and sale of my personal information, constituting identity theft. 
5. Data Breach Contribution : The breaches at XXXX and XXXX have further exacerbated the identity theft issue, allowing my information to be misused in this manner. 

Applicable Laws and Violations 1. Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) Unverified Reporting : Under the FCRA ( 15 U.S.C. 1681s-2 ), companies are prohibited from furnishing inaccurate or unverified information to credit reporting agencies. Midland Funding has reported a debt without verifying its validity or ensuring it is accurate.

Failure to Investigate Disputes : The FCRA requires a thorough investigation of disputes. Midland Funding failed to conduct a proper investigation or provide evidence of the accounts legitimacy. 
Damaging Credit Reporting : Their continued reporting of this fraudulent account has harmed my credit profile without proper documentation or verification, violating my rights under the FCRA. 

2. Fair Debt Collection Practices Act ( FDCPA ) Failure to Provide Debt Validation : Midland Funding failed to provide proof of the debt upon request, violating FDCPA requirements under 15 U.S.C. 1692g. 
Violation of Cease-and-Desist Request : Despite agreeing to my request for a cease and desist, Midland Funding continues to report negatively to credit bureaus, violating 15 U.S.C. 1692c ( c ). 
Unfair and Deceptive Practices : By pursuing a debt resulting from identity theft, they are engaging in unfair and deceptive practices prohibited under 15 U.S.C. 1692d-f.

3. Identity Theft and Privacy Protections Illegal Use and Sale of Information :
Midland Funding and the original creditor, whoever they may be, violated my rights under privacy laws by buying and selling my information without consent. This constitutes identity theft under the Identity Theft and Assumption Deterrence Act ( 18 U.S.C. 1028 ). 
Data Breach Contribution : The XXXX and XXXX breaches, which enabled my personal information to be accessed and misused, highlight systemic issues that require investigation and enforcement. 

I have disputed with XXXX and XXXX several times and no one has yet to remove this account as it doesnt belong to me.

2025-02-04,Credit reporting or other personal consumer reports,Credit reporting,Incorrect information on your report,Account information incorrect,"Dear CFPB, I am filing a formal complaint against XXXX XXXX XXXX for misrepresentation of loan payments, unjustified repossession fees, identity errors, and false credit reporting. A detailed review of my loan documents and XXXX  own records reveals severe discrepancies, unexplained charges, and violations of multiple consumer protection laws, including the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) and the Truth in Lending Act ( TILA ). 

XXXX XXXX inconsistent accounting, misleading credit reporting, and excessive post-repossession fees have created an unfair financial burden on me. I demand a full investigation, removal of unjustified charges, correction of my credit report, and a full breakdown of my alleged balance. 

XXXX. XXXX XXXX Misrepresented My Loan Balance & Payments XXXXXXXX XXXX own documents claim I made {$46000.00} in payments. However, after reviewing line-by-line transactions, it is clear that {$8500.00} of these payments were reversedmeaning my actual payments total only {$30000.00}. 

Breakdown of Payments vs. Reversals : Total Payments Recorded by XXXX : {$46000.00} Total Reversed Payments ( Returned/Cancelled ) : {$8500.00} Actual Payments Made : {$30000.00} Original Loan Balance : {$39000.00} Charged-Off Balance Claimed by XXXX : {$24000.00} Major Issues : XXXX included reversed payments XXXX their records, inflating my total payments to make it appear I still owe more than I should. 
Even after I paid over {$30000.00}, XXXX still claims I owe nearly {$25000.00}, which does not align with basic loan math. 
Failure to properly credit payments violates the Truth in Lending Act ( TILA ), which requires clear disclosure of how payments are applied. 

XXXX. XXXX Charged Excessive and Unjustified Repo Fees After repossessing my vehicle, XXXX XXXX piled on thousands of dollars in unexplained fees, including : {$530.00} ( XX/XX/year> ) {$530.00} ( XX/XX/year> ) {$290.00} ( XX/XX/year> ) {$110.00} ( XX/XX/year> ) {$30.00}, {$28.00}, {$110.00}, {$260.00} ( XX/XX/year> ) {$8200.00} ( XX/XX/year> ) A massive charge with no breakdown or explanation {$1300.00} ( XX/XX/year> ) Key Issues : XXXX has not provided a detailed breakdown of these fees or whether they were disclosed in my original loan agreement. 
They failed to show how much my repossessed vehicle was sold for, and whether that amount was properly deducted from my balance. 
It is illegal to continue adding interest after repossession, yet XXXX balance appears to be inflated even after the car was seized. 

XXXX. XXXX is Reporting False Information to Credit Bureaus ( FCRA Violation ) XXXX XXXX is reporting inaccurate and misleading information about this loan, violating the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ). 

Key Errors in Credit Reporting : Inconsistent Names on the Loan : My name is incorrectly reported in multiple ways : XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ( extra repetition of XXXX and XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ( completely incorrect last name ) If XXXX can not prove I signed for this loan under the correct legal name, they must delete this account from my credit report. 
Incorrect Loan Balance : The reported balance does not reflect actual payments made or the proper deduction of the vehicles sale price.

Misrepresented Payment History : Payments that were reversed or never cleared were still included in their total calculations. 

XXXX. XXXX Violated Federal Consumer Protection Laws Truth in Lending Act ( TILA ) Violations Failure to accurately disclose how payments were applied Unclear reporting of balance calculations Charging excessive fees without proper itemization Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) Violations Reporting false and unverifiable data to credit bureaus Failing to correct identity errors and payment discrepancies Unfair and Deceptive Acts or Practices ( UDAP ) Violations Inflating loan balances with post-repossession charges and misapplied payments Lack of transparency in repossession procedures and deductions.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,"TRANSUNION INTERMEDIATE HOLDINGS, INC.",TX,774XX,,Consent provided,Web,2025-02-04,Closed with non-monetary relief,Yes,N/A,11900628

On [ XXXX XXXX, XXXX ], I submitted a dispute regarding [ specific information in your credit report, e.g., an incorrect account, inaccurate payment history, or unauthorized inquiries ]. Despite the FCRAs requirement for Experian to complete its reinvestigation and provide results within 30 days, I have yet to receive a resolution or written notice of the investigations findings as of today, [ XXXX XXXX, XXXX ]. This constitutes a clear violation of 15 U.S.C. 1681i ( a ) ( 1 ) ( A ), which mandates timely processing of consumer disputes. 

The lack of timely communication and resolution has caused me considerable inconvenience and potential harm to my financial standing. To address this issue, I respectfully request : A detailed explanation for the delay in resolving my dispute. 

Immediate completion of the reinvestigation and correction of any inaccurate information in my credit report. 

Confirmation of the reinvestigation results, including what changes, if any, were made to my credit report. 

Enclosed, you will find copies of all relevant documentation, including my initial dispute letter, supporting evidence, and any subsequent correspondence for your reference. Please consider this as a formal request to expedite the resolution of this matter. 

Failure to comply with the requirements outlined in the FCRA may compel me to seek assistance from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ) or pursue other legal remedies to ensure my rights as a consumer are protected.

Incorrect Account Information : Upon contacting XXXX, I was informed that the phone number attached to this alleged account is XXXX, while the document provided by the collection agency lists XXXX. This discrepancy demonstrates that the account information referenced is not accurate or associated with my XXXX account. 

Failure to Validate the Debt : Upon contacting XXXX directly, I was informed that they could not validate or confirm the debt presented by the collection agency. 
These discrepancies indicate potential violations of federal laws, as outlined below : Failure to Validate Debt Properly ( 15 U.S. Code 1692g ) : Debt collectors are required to provide accurate and sufficient validation of a debt upon request.

Misrepresentation ( 15 U.S. Code 1692e ) : The FDCPA prohibits debt collectors from using false or deceptive means to collect a debt. Providing incorrect information about the address and account details constitutes a clear violation of this provision.

Inaccurate Information Furnished to Credit Reporting Agencies ( 15 U.S. Code 1681s-2 ) : If this debt has been reported to credit bureaus, it violates federal law, as furnishers are prohibited from reporting inaccurate or unverifiable information.

The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ) has recently filed a lawsuit against Experian, alleging systemic issues such as failing to forward consumer-provided evidence to furnishers, accepting unreliable responses, and failing to adequately notify consumers of dispute outcomes.

2025-01-21,Credit reporting or other personal consumer reports,Credit reporting,Incorrect information on your report,Personal information incorrect,"I recently disputed an incorrect address listed on my credit report and provided clear evidence of my current address. Despite this, the credit bureau refused to remove the incorrect XXXX, Texas address, claiming it was linked to an account I hold with XXXX. To address this issue, I contacted all companies reporting on my credit file to confirm the accuracy of their information. Each company, including XXXX, verified that their records were up-to-date and did not include the incorrect address. 

I then requested the credit bureau to provide evidence linking the disputed address to any account. Upon reviewing the information provided by the credit bureau, I verified this with XXXX, which confirmed that they do not have any account or record associated with a XXXX address. This clearly shows that the credit bureau failed to conduct a proper investigation, as required under FCRA 611 ( 15 U.S.C. 1681i ), which mandates a reasonable reinvestigation of disputed information.

In addition to the address dispute, I challenged inaccuracies regarding account statuses, incorrect open/close dates, and accounts that were not opened by me. To safeguard my identity, I placed a security freeze on my credit report, notified the bureaus of potential identity theft, and filed a police report pursuant to FCRA 605B ( 15 U.S.C. 1681c-2 ), which outlines procedures for handling identity theft disputes.

Despite taking these steps, the credit bureau continues to mishandle my case. When I called and specifically requested to speak with the fraud department, I was transferred to the general information services team multiple times, delaying any meaningful resolution. This failure to provide adequate support violates FCRA 607 ( b ) ( 15 U.S.C. 1681e ( b ) ), which requires credit reporting agencies to maintain maximum possible accuracy in consumer reports. 

While XXXX conducted a thorough and proper investigation of their records, the credit bureau has failed to remove the incorrect address and rectify other disputed inaccuracies. Their failure to properly investigate and correct these errors is a direct violation of their obligations under FCRA 611 and 605A, which addresses the need for heightened standards when fraud or identity theft is involved.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,Experian Information Solutions Inc.,MN,55106,,Consent provided,Web,2025-01-21,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,11723314

This was for a gas station purchases for gas in XXXX. I only purchased gas, I did not authorize a charge for {$180.00}, and the car could not physically hold anywhere close to {$180.00} of gas at the price per liter that the station was charging. Subsequently I read reviews of the gas station showed that the practice of fraudulently overcharging was common. 

Note that my credit card number recently changed. I am providing the current card number in this complaint. If the original card number is required please contact me. 

I provided all of the documentation and proof available to me ( several times ). On XX/XX/XXXX, they denied because I had not provided proof that the correct amount should have been {$65.00}. I called back on XX/XX/XXXX and explained that it was not possible to know the exact correct amount because I was not given a receipt. Furthermore, I had not authorized a charge of {$180.00} and the entire amount should be considered fraudulent ( I had only provided the {$65.00} estimate to try to be fair ). The correct amount is {$0.00} because I had not authorized {$180.00} and {$180.00} is a physically impossible amount of gas to purchase in that car. I purchased XXXX of a tank which is XXXX gallons or XXXX liters and at XXXX pesos per liter XXXX pesos or {$51.00} USD.

They agreed and said they would reopen the case. 

I have been receiving statements from my credit card company showing the {$110.00} amount as in dispute, so my belief was that the amount was still in dispute. It turns out that the dispute processor used by the credit card company had not done what they said they would- they did not reopen the case. The amount in dispute of {$110.00} showing my statements appears to be misleading. This still shows on the most recent XXXX statement - 6 months after the disptue processor closed the case and neglected to reopen it.

Their mishandling of my claims, lack of transparency, and continuous delays have caused me significant financial hardship and emotional distress.

Background of the Issue : 1. Disputed Transactions : I reported unauthorized transactions totaling [ $ amount ] on my account. These transactions occurred in locations I have never visited and during times when I was verifiably elsewhere.

Despite providing supporting documentation, including [ evidence provided, such as police reports, travel logs, or other relevant information ], Bank of America has refused to reimburse the funds.

2. Repeated Requests for "" New Information '' : Bank of America has repeatedly requested "" new information '' to process my claims. However, they have failed to specify what additional information is required, despite my efforts to comply.

This vague and unreasonable demand has delayed the resolution process and exacerbated my financial and emotional distress.

3. Violation of Federal Regulations : Under the Electronic Fund Transfer Act ( EFTA ), Bank of America is required to investigate and resolve disputes within 45 days. Additionally, they are obligated to provisionally credit the disputed amount while investigating. They have not adhered to these requirements.

Their continued delays and lack of clear communication violate the Dodd-Frank Act, which prohibits unfair, deceptive, or abusive acts or practices ( UDAAP ).

4. Negligence in Protecting My Account : Bank of America failed to implement adequate security measures to prevent unauthorized transactions on my account. This negligence directly contributed to the financial loss I have suffered.

Impact of Bank of Americas Actions : The banks mishandling of my claims has caused : Severe financial hardship, as I have been deprived of the funds necessary to meet basic needs.

Emotional and psychological distress due to the prolonged and unjustified delays.

Loss of trust in their ability to protect my account and act in good faith.

Request for Resolution : I respectfully request the CFPB to intervene and require Bank of America to : 1. Fully reimburse the disputed amount of [ $ amount ] immediately.

2. Provide a detailed explanation of their handling of my claims and their failure to comply with federal regulations.

3. Implement stronger safeguards to prevent future unauthorized transactions and improve transparency in their claims process.

Supporting Documentation : I have attached the following documents to support my complaint : Copies of all correspondence with Bank of America regarding this matter.

Evidence of unauthorized transactions ( e.g., police reports, account statements ). 

Documentation of the financial and emotional impact of this issue.

These issues have significantly impacted my financial stability, mental health, and overall well-being. The following outlines the practices and misconduct I have endured : 1. Unauthorized Accounts and Services Bank of America has added services to my accounts and opened products without my explicit authorization. These actions resulted in fees and account changes I did not request or agree to.

2. Deceptive Practices The bank repeatedly provided misleading information regarding fees, terms, and conditions of my accounts. For instance, I was not informed of overdraft protection terms, and certain fees were applied without notice.

3. Overdraft Practices I have been charged excessive overdraft fees, including multiple charges for the same transaction. Additionally, I was automatically enrolled in overdraft protection without my consent, causing unnecessary fees to accumulate over time.

4. Improper Handling of Disputes Bank of America failed to investigate disputes involving unauthorized transactions and identity theft in a timely manner. My repeated efforts to resolve these disputes were met with delays, improper conclusions, and violations of legal timelines for dispute resolution. 

5. Discrimination As a single, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, I believe I have been subjected to discriminatory practices. My concerns were dismissed, and I was denied the assistance and accommodations needed to manage my accounts effectively. 

6. Debt Collection Practices The bank attempted to collect debts that were invalid or already settled. These actions caused undue financial stress and exacerbated my existing hardships. 

7. Unlawful Fees Bank of America charged fees for services I did not authorize or request. These charges were inconsistent, unexplained, and financially damaging.

8. Failure to Safeguard Consumer Information Due to the banks negligence in securing my personal information, I became a victim of identity theft. Despite notifying the bank of these issues, my accounts remained unprotected, exposing me to further fraudulent activity.

9. Loan Servicing Errors Bank of America mishandled loan payments by applying them incorrectly and providing me with inaccurate payoff information. This mismanagement caused confusion and financial difficulties. 

10. Violation of Fair Credit Reporting The bank reported inaccurate information to credit bureaus, which negatively affected my credit score. Despite notifying the bank, these inaccuracies were not corrected. 

Consequences of These Violations These practices have caused significant harm, including : Financial instability, resulting in multiple evictions. 

Emotional distress and mental health deterioration. 

An unsafe and unpredictable environment for my child. 

Long-term financial damage due to identity theft and fraudulent activities. 


Request for Investigation and Relief I am requesting that the CFPB investigate these matters thoroughly and hold Bank of America accountable for its actions. I am also seeking restitution for the financial losses and emotional distress caused by their misconduct. 

Enclosed with this complaint are relevant documents and evidence to support my claims. Please let me know if additional information is required. I trust that your office will address this matter promptly and ensure that justice is served.

Balance and Past Due Amount : Both XXXX and Experian report a balance of {$4500.00} and a past-due amount of {$4500.00}. These figures should be verified for accuracy with the creditor, as they may no longer reflect the current account status.

Last Reported and Date Last Active : XXXX lists the "" Last Reported '' date as XX/XX/XXXX and the "" Date Last Active '' as the same. Experian, however, reports the "" Date Last Active '' as XX/XX/XXXX. These discrepancies must be reconciled and updated with accurate information. 
Date of Last Payment : Both bureaus report the date of last payment as XX/XX/XXXX. Please confirm that this date is correct and corresponds with the creditors records. 
Requested Actions : Conduct a comprehensive investigation with the original creditor or data furnisher to verify the account information.

2024-11-25,Credit reporting or other personal consumer reports,Credit reporting,Incorrect information on your report,Information is missing that should be on the report,""" The Fair Credit Reporting Act ( 15 U.S. Code 1681 ) says ( 1 ) The banking system is dependent upon fair and accurate credit reporting. Inaccurate credit reports directly impair the efficiency of the banking system, and unfair credit reporting methods undermine the public confidence, which is essential to the continued functioning of the banking system. 
So whenever there is a violation under the FCRA, it impairs the efficiency of the banking system. This is a violation of my privacy with my consumer report, since I control what is listed and what is not. In the event that any accounts are reported without my written consent, that is considered identity theft. 


This is a violation of both 15 U.S. Code 1681b ( 2 ) and 15 U.S. Code 1681c-2. This leads way to civil liability against the credit reporting agency for negligent and willful noncompliance under 15 U.S. Code 1681n, which allows for {$1000.00} per violation, for each account listed without my expressed written consent. 
I looked at my consumer reports and noticed accounts I never gave anyone permission to report. Consumer reporting agencies have assumed a vital role and have a responsibility to report consumer information to the best of their ability with maximum possible accuracy like the Fair Credit Reporting Act clearly states. I did not provide written consent to report them.

Specifically, I am disputing the continued reporting of an account that I believe should no longer be included. 

The account details are as follows : Creditor Name :XX/XX/XXXXAccount Number : XXXX XXXX Date of Delinquency/Charge-off/Closure : XX/XX/XXXX Nature of Dispute : The debt in question should have been removed due to the passage of the [ seven-year ] reporting limit under 15 USC Code 1681c. Furthermore, I never received a Form 1099-C for the alleged cancellation of debt, which raises questions regarding the validity and status of this account.

Since I did not receive a Form 1099-C, there is no record that this debt was officially canceled or forgiven. This lack of documentation further supports my belief that the information is either obsolete or inaccurate and should not be included in my credit file. 

I request that you : 1. Immediately remove the outdated or incorrect account from my credit report.

2. Conduct a thorough investigation to verify the accuracy of this information and determine why a Form 1099-C was not issued.

3. Provide me with written confirmation that the disputed information has been removed or corrected once your investigation is complete. 

Under the FCRA, you are required to investigate this matter and correct any inaccuracies or outdated information within 30 days. Please consider this letter a formal dispute. 

I have enclosed a copy of my credit report with the disputed item highlighted, as well as copies of identification documents to verify my identity.
